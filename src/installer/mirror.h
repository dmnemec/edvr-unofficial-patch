// A copy of the player's edvr.ini that a game update cannot reach.
//
// Every file this installer manages -- edvr.ini, edvr.ini.base, state.ini, the
// backups in edvr_backup\ -- lives INSIDE the game folder, because that is the
// only folder guaranteed to still be there next time. On 2026-09-02 that
// guarantee failed: an Elite Dangerous update wiped a whole install folder --
// d3d11.dll, openvr_api_orig.dll, edvr.ini, edvr.ini.base, state.ini, every
// edvr_backup\ stamp -- and put back only the files IT owns. Fifty tuned
// settings and hours of field work survived purely because a chat transcript
// happened to have a copy.
//
// So a second copy is kept somewhere a game update has no reason to touch:
// %LOCALAPPDATA%\EDVR\, well outside the game's own folder tree. It is not a
// replacement for edvr_backup\ -- that is what an uninstall restores from, and
// it stays exactly as it was. This is a mirror of last resort, refreshed on
// every install and every settings change, whose only job is to still exist
// when the game folder does not.
