// openvr_api_orig.dll the game's original or a leftover? Was the file now
// sitting in our place put there by another mod, or by an older EDVR?
//
// A record turns all of those into facts. It also carries the shipped edvr.ini
// of the installed version -- the base a three-way merge needs to tell "the
// user changed this" from "the default changed".
//
// It is written in the same ini dialect the game reads, for the same reason
// the logs are plain text: somebody diagnosing a broken install should be able
