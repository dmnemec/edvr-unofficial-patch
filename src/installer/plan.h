// That split is not tidiness. The interesting cases -- EDHM already installed
// as d3d11.dll, a game update that put the stock openvr_api.dll back over ours,
// another mod's uninstaller deleting our proxy, a rename that lost the game's
// original runtime -- are exactly the ones that are hard to reproduce on a real
// machine and easy to get wrong. A planner that is a pure function of a Survey
// can have every one of them written down as a test (tools/installer_test), and
// the GUI can show the user the plan before a single file moves.
