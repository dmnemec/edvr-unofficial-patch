// the surface tracks the game's INTERNAL render width, which is not a fixed
// multiple of the submitted eye. On the third configuration the fraction is
// 0.036 out -- nine times the tolerance this used -- so the fix silently
// never engaged there at all. Reported from the field before it was found
// here, which is the honest order.
