// --- The keyed pool families -------------------------------------------------
// Vertex-shader hash -> the pixel shaders measured with it (blur-on run 043720
// and the 09-06 dump; docs/kinematic-motion-injection-2026-09-19.md). A hash
// that is not here is not substituted: after a game update the family stands
// down by name, the way every keyed fix in EDVR does -- and so does a shader
// another mod (EDHM's 3Dmigoto) replaces: its hash is not here.
//
// The station (eye run 143416, docs/kinematic-motion-injection-2026-09-19.md
// "The station"): ps_CB429E043DBB2506 (vs_DE54, 108 station instances a frame)
// and ps_451A82D4DD1BA254 (vs_61AE) drew station parts stock, so their pixels
// kept the camera term while the station turned; both keyed, each proven by
// the corpus identity harness (o0..o3 and depth bit-identical). Not keyed:
// ps_B7D50283329322C3 (vs_EB52 -- the commander's legs, records 2 m away;
// decided).
//
// Flight 6 (153446: the shader dump armed at a station, the "Flight 6" entry):
// vs_436193B352A2897E, the station's biggest pool shader (547 of its 1193
// instances a frame, 143416) with its only pixel shader ps_16940F576006BE65;
// vs_889A5279E68F0672 with ps_B46E52A1E0B2F39C (the station) and
// ps_EBA95E15B0A66102 -- each pair through the corpus identity harness
// (40,960 texels, 0 mismatches; MRT6 8192 checked, 0 bad). DE54/91F8 is now
// flat-only: its SV_IsFrontFace occupies the register formerly assumed for
// PS position. A separate rasterizer input passes the actual VS draw gate.
// DE54/A607 remains unqualified and unkeyed.
//
// Eye run 055427 (2026-09-26, parked at the port, the "close range" entry):
// vs_61AE's stock pixel shader ps_4504BC268E109C31 drew hull parts all
// session, and the two big rotating families drew NOTHING through their keyed
// pairs at this range -- vs_4361 through ps_51EE1F922FD220B0, vs_889A through
// ps_D31DCAFA7C05CB47, both stock -- so most of the hull kept the camera term
// while it moved. All three keyed: ps_4504 from the 09-06 dump, ps_51EE and
// ps_D31D dumped by the 2026-09-27 glare_shader_dump flight at the port; each
// pair through the corpus identity harness (40,960 texels, 0 mismatches;
// MRT6 8192 checked, 0 bad). ps_BBDE4E71FB78528A (vs_66DE) keyed from the
// 15:46 session's dumps the same day. Provenance correction, 2026-09-28:
// ps_BA58469C3D6120A7 is the exact EDVR patch of ps_4375B72964F386CD,
// not another stock variant. Its occupied slot is our existing export.
// Likewise all kSelfMarking hashes are generated substitutions; see their
