// is passed through raw. Everything after that is an honest projective
// transform -- cb0[9..11] to world, cb1[270..273] to clip -- so z does reach
// the screen, which is what the field probe measured.
//

// curvature 0.3 displaces the edges by 0.44 model units against a panel
// whose half-width is size.x model units. If size.x is tens, that is a
// percent or two of depth: real, correct, and invisible in stereo -- while
// the arc-length narrowing in x rides the scaled basis and shows at full
// strength. Exactly the field's report of a squish with no bend.
//
// So the bend is expressed in the same units as the width it bends by
// multiplying z by size.x. That is read from the game's own SIZE buffer
