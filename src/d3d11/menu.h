// The in-headset settings menu (docs/settings-menu.md).
//
// Every knob EDVR has is a taste-and-cost trade that can only be judged with
// the headset on, over the scene that is actually struggling. This is the
// panel that lets it be judged there: summoned by hotkey.menu, anchored in
// the world where you were looking, driven by the arrow keys or by where
// your head points, and written straight into edvr.ini so the game's own
// reload applies it -- the file stays the single source of truth, and the
// installer's window and this panel can never disagree.
//
// While a settings page is drawn the keyboard is the menu's (input_gate.h): the
// game sees every key released, so Up, Down, Enter and Escape are free to
// mean what they say. The gate follows the DRAW, not the menu's belief: a
// panel that is not reaching the headset never takes the keyboard.
// The read-only Status and Monitor pages deliberately pass keys to the game.
//
// Elite's own panel keys -- UI_Up .. CyclePreviousPage, the ones that walk
// the cockpit panels -- are read from the player's bindings and become
// ALIASES of the menu's own actions: the same dispatcher, never a second
// one, and never registered as Hotkeys. They are inert unless the gate
// provably holds the game's keyboard (elsewhere an adopted key IS a game
// key), inert while a value is typed, and a key held across a state change
// is swallowed until released -- except the next/previous tab pair, which
// follows Tab and changes the page on the shared pages too. menu_keys.h
// holds the rules; the panel's bottom line names the live keys.
//
// This half owns the model, the keys, the aim, the ini write and the restart
// bookkeeping. menu_panel.h owns the pixels: the GDI rasterisation and the
// compute composite the openvr half calls at the door.
