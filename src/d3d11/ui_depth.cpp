// THE FLIGHT HUD'S COVERAGE, for the depth pass in the scene's projection.

// Under the writing twin the HUD's own draw wrote depth over every pixel of
// each stroke's bounding quad, and once the temporal pass registered a
// station's turn (docs/per-object-motion.md, tier 2) the station under a
// target bracket showed "a quad that is blurred under the bracket" (the
// player, 2026-09-08): those pixels carried the bracket's depth and not the
// station's. The shader's disassembly (ps 8DEF46452FA459F5, the dump of
// 2026-09-06) says why no discard saves them: after a manual depth test
// against the eye-sized depth resolve at t0 (v1 holds the clip position),
// a fade from the distance and the element's own strength, and the
// geometry of one stroke -- a capsule from TEXCOORD5 to TEXCOORD16 of
// radius TEXCOORD13.w, the ray from TEXCOORD0 through the pixel's world
// point in TEXCOORD18 -- it marches cb1[203].w steps along the ray inside
// that capsule, sampling three octaves of value noise from t1, and the
// density at each step is a smoothstep of (noise * 0.571 - q), q being the
// normalised squared distance from the stroke's axis. Where q exceeds the
// noise the sum is nought, the transmittance stays one, and the pixel is
// emitted at alpha nought with its depth written all the same.
//
// The opacity calculation follows the captured PS, including its noise,
// strength, ray length and fade. Only genuinely opaque cores own motion;
// transparent station detail under the glyph keeps its scene motion.

//   Target (t2): the game's OWN RT0 resource -- the same one this pass's

//   THAT RTV's own view format, so it decodes in the SAME space the

//   The SHARE test (share of the pixel's light this element supplies)

//   Display (t3): the actual submitted, tonemapped image (temporal_pass's
//   inSrv) -- what is actually on screen. The FLOOR test (must the pixel
//   be visibly lit) compares against this, encoded to display space only
//   if its own view is sRGB (a plain view is display-encoded already).
// Either can be absent (an unviewable target; a missing or wrong-sized
// display image); each absence is handled on its own, never disqualifying
// the other test. Without a display image the floor falls back to the
// contribution's own space (linearBlend: the TARGET's view was sRGB).
// ElementDepth clears to 0 (reversed-Z far), so d>0 alone only rejects a
// pixel nothing listed drew into -- a world marker's own depth survives
// it at any range, and so does a cockpit family's far fragment (the sun's
// corona), harmlessly: cockpitRange (radiusDepth, below) is false for it.
//
// A UI-covered pixel (the interface's own reactive mask, UiMask below,
// bit 0) discards before any other test. The UI depth pass has already
// stamped it with its own element's exact depth, and a holo record
// there (when one exists) gives exact record motion -- this pass's own
// element-depth footprint is only the NEAREST listed draw at that
// pixel, however transparent, which can belong to a different element
// supplying none of the light there. A hangar's HEATSINK label,
// UI-covered with a holo record: 97% record-depth matched with the
// pass off, 0-7% with it on and overwriting the letters at another
// listed draw's depth (dumps 115037 pass-off, 115012 round 8, 123118
// round 9). Frame-wide, the same dumps: every UI-covered pixel with a
// holo record sits at the record's own depth with the pass off (100%),
// against 95.9% with it on.
//
// A dark pixel (the displayed colour never clears the floor) near a
// cockpit-range element's own light -- its own block of the near-light
// map (below), or one of that block's 8 neighbours -- takes a FILLER
// depth, skipping the share test: it is the gap between glyphs on a
// panel, or between rows of text, and giving it the sky's depth instead
// of a near one is what makes rolling text blur (flight
// 20260924_175113/20260925_050051 -- the gaps carry the sky's motion,
// glyphs the panel's, and a natural near-zero-world-motion frame in the
// same dump reads crisp because the two motions briefly matched). Under
// roll the filler keeps the gap moving with the cockpit, not the sky,
// while sitting just inside the cockpit radius -- behind the element's
// own depth -- so DLSS still finds a real depth edge at the glyphs
// themselves. Writing the element's own depth into the gap instead (a
// hangar's station text, dumps 115012 pass-on/115037 pass-off) put the
// whole gap a median 1 mm nearer than the letters, on depth-path motion
// 0.17 px/frame off the letters' exact record motion, and DLSS resolved
// gap and glyph as one flat slab that doubled and bolded the strokes. Far dark fragments are
// still excluded by cockpitRange before the near-light test ever runs,
// so the corona still cannot claim dark pixels (the bracket-history
// regression of 2026-09-09 this guards against). GREATER
// (holoElementDepthState) leaves a nearer real scene surface alone --
// that hangar's gaps keep the console at 3.9 m, as they read pass-off --
// so the filler only lands where the private copy already holds
// something farther: sky, or far world. A bright
// pixel still needs the share test it always did, unaffected by any of
// this, so a bright background showing through a translucent gap (a
// star, a lit station behind a panel) is still excluded on its own
// light, not the element's.

// surfaces updated damage-style, a draw or two a frame across four
// families of which one is the GUI renderer's, composited into the eye
// by the general world-quad pipeline sampling them at PS slot 1. The
// chrome tracker (vscreen.cpp) recognises the composite by content hash
// and the surface's size before this module sees the draw, and hands the
// surface over here: learned if the offscreen learner above had not
// (it asks a new target's vertex shader sixty-four times, and the graph's
// labels are drawn once), and held for the frame either way.
//
// The flight of b43e3ce (eye dump 190129, docs/fss-scanner.md) found the
// learn idle: both strata were already learned, both composites
// classified and reissued, and what left the graph's strokes and its
// "FILTERED SPECTRAL ANALYSIS" unmasked was the alpha floor -- in two
// dumps the mask is a clean threshold on the composite's brightness
// (luma 80 and up masked, under 60 never), the signature of clip(a -
// floor) on a stratum drawn dim. So this says which way it went, once
// per outcome, distinguishable from a learn; and the surfaces go out
// with an eye run (Chrome0/Chrome1) so the strokes' alpha is read off
// the chrome itself rather than inferred through the composite. Read
// (eye_194158_Chrome0): the dim strokes sit at alpha 51-77 of 255, the
// labels at 166 and up, nothing else is non-zero -- hence the held
// surface's composites take the one-step floor (kChromeFloorSlot).
// The tracker also matches the loading screen's panel (same pipeline,
// same size class), so a loader's dialog gets the one-step floor too:
// under fix.loading_dim = screen (the default) the intro's scrim is
// withheld and nothing translucent is in that surface; where the stock
// scrim draws (loading_dim = stock, or a loader after the intro) its 40%
// over the ship model writes depth for that dialog's duration -- the
// case the general floor was set for, brief and head-locked here.
