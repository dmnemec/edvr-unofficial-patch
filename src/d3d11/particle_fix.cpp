// claim that its instruction body was byte-identical and it would get the
// flare's replacement free. It is not a twin, and the claim came from a
// comparison that could not have detected the difference: it read only
// indented lines, so it skipped every dcl_output, and semantic INDICES do
// not appear in the instruction stream at all -- they live in the
// signature block, which no instruction diff reads.
//
// The two shaders write the same values to DIFFERENT output registers
// (max o2.y against max o1.y, utof o1.w against utof o0.w), declare
// different masks, and carry different TEXCOORD indices: the flare emits
// TEXCOORD 2/4/7/9 and 9AEC596A2B036EA6 emits 3/6/8/9. Substituting the
// flare's replacement handed its pixel shader the wrong registers.
//
// What it draws is the WITCHSPACE STARFIELD, and in 0.12.3 that starfield
// disappeared. Field-confirmed 2026-08-30 by census_skip on this hash.

// and its own transcription written. Likeness is not evidence, and the

// Skipping the draw is not how 0.12.3 removed it. That fed the draw a
