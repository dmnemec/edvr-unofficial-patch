// confirmed long before, because a false trip costs them every fix for a
// session and that is the cost this must not impose casually.
//
// THIS ONE WAS BROKEN TWICE OVER as 600 presented frames. It was 8.3 seconds at
// 72Hz and 5 at 120, and worse, presented frames are not paced by the display
// during a loading screen -- the menu and loading screen present at about
// 1800fps, so 600 of them went by in a third of a second and the sentinel
// confirmed survival before the game had drawn anything at all. The window
// that was supposed to cover the risky period closed before it started.
//
// AND THEN IT WAS BROKEN A THIRD TIME, as six seconds of WALL CLOCK measured
// from the first Present -- which one stalled frame can spend on its own.
// Issue #20, 2026-09-05: the temporal pass compiles its HLSL synchronously in
// the first frame's vScreenFrameBoundary, and on the reporter's rig fxc took
// 6.26 seconds over it ("internal warning: optimization did not converge").
// Present #2 therefore arrived at +6.3 s, the window was satisfied by a single
// frame nobody had rendered, the .armed file was deleted, and the crash 2.2
// seconds later left no trip behind. Measured across twenty crashes in one
// breadcrumb file: fifteen at 8.6-9.6 s with the pass on and never a stand-down
// after them, four at 2.4 s with it off and a stand-down after every one. The
// protection was absent in exactly the configuration that needed it, and the
// user's report was "temporal_aa crashes the game" when what it did was hide
// the sentinel.
//
// So the window is now six seconds of PRESENTING, accumulated from the gaps
// between Presents, and a gap longer than kSentinelMaxFrameMs contributes
// nothing at all. A stall is not evidence the hooks survived anything; it is

    // THE SWAP-ONLY PROBE, which stands in for both context installers.

    // Two users' machines die 1.7 seconds after the private-copy mode goes in.
    // The in-place mode is stable on both -- and on both, the runtime
    // overwrites every in-place thunk before the first frame, so in that mode
    // EDVR's thunks never run at all. That is the one clean difference between
    // the mode that dies and the mode that lives: whether our code executes on
    // the context's calls. And it leaves exactly two suspects with nothing in
    // between: the vptr swap itself, or what twenty-nine thunks DO once they are
    // running.
    //
    // This removes the second. The context gets a private copy of its table
    // with nothing patched -- every call runs the code it always ran, from a
    // different address -- and neither installer runs, so no thunk exists to
    // execute. If the game still dies, the swap is fatal on its own and the
    // thunks were never the problem. If it lives, the mechanism is innocent,
    // the bug is in what a thunk does, and that is a bisection rather than a
    // new hooking design.
    //
    // A pass-through thunk was considered and is not built, because from the
    // GPU's side it is the swap plus one extra call frame -- it would answer
    // the same question as this, less cleanly.
    // AND ITS TWIN, which takes the other half away instead.
    //
    // The swap-only probe removes the thunks and keeps two things: the vptr is
    // RELOCATED and the table is FROZEN. If it crashes, that is still ambiguous
    // -- "relocating the vptr is fatal" and "freezing the table is fatal" are
    // different bugs with different fixes and the one probe cannot separate
    // them. The LIVE-ONLY probe keeps the relocation and removes the freeze:
    // every entry of the private table is a stub that reads the context's own
    // slot at the moment of the call, so no call can ever reach an
    // implementation the runtime has moved on from, and still no EDVR code runs
    // inside any context method. Run the two and the answer is arithmetic.
