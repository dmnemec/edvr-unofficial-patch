// The settings menu's pixels: rasterised on the CPU, composited at the door.
//
// RASTERISATION is GDI into a 32-bit DIB -- CreateFontW and DrawTextW, the
// installer's own text path, and the game already imports GDI32, so nothing
// new enters the process. It runs on a worker thread, on CHANGE only, and
// hands the frame thread a finished RGBA bitmap to upload; per frame the
// panel costs one compute dispatch per eye and nothing on the CPU.
//
// Two passes make one premultiplied bitmap: the same draw list rendered once
// in colour over the panel's premultiplied background, and once in white
// over the background's alpha, so the second image IS the first's coverage.
// GDI blends antialiased text exactly the way premultiplied compositing
// wants, which is what makes the two-pass trick exact rather than a guess.
//
// TYPE IN DEGREES. The bitmap is sized from the headset's own pixels per
// degree at the panel (eye size and tangents from the channel), so a Pimax
// and a Quest 3 get the same apparent size from different pixel counts, and
// the panel composites near 1:1 -- native-crisp whatever render scale says.
//
// THE COMPOSITE is a compute pass in the FSS theater's shape: per output
// pixel of the eye's region, build the view ray from the published
// tangents, rotate it into the anchor's frame, intersect the panel (flat or
// on a cylinder), and blend the sampled bitmap over the frame's pixel. The
// source is read through a view or a copy, never written; the result is an
// EDVR-owned region-sized texture the openvr half forwards, the sharpen
// pass's exact contract.
