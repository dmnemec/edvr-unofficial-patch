// The particle billboards' orientation, and the probe that measures it.
//
// Elite draws smoke, steam and similar particles as quads whose basis is
// built from two vectors in the vertex shader's second constant buffer:
//
//     right = normalize(cross(cb1[278], cb1[279]))
//     up    = normalize(cross(cb1[279], right))
//
// cb1[279] is the camera's view direction (the same vector feeds the
// near-fade's depth term); cb1[278] is its up. A camera basis in a headset
// is a HEAD basis, so head roll rolls every particle quad -- the geyser
// plumes rotating with the headset. Read from the game's own bytecode:
// docs/shaders/particle-vs.asm, with the whole story in docs/particle-billboards.md.
//
// The probe logs those registers at a matched draw so the inference above
// can be confirmed by measurement before anything is substituted -- which
// vector tracks head ROLL is the one a fix must replace, and guessing it
// costs a field session.
