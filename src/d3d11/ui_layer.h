// fix.ui_quality -- the UI layer (docs/ui-layer-2026-09-23.md; Design A of
// docs/crisp-ui-handoff.md, phase 1). The key's other half, every
// render-to-texture panel at the target's size, is ui_panel_scale.h.
//
// The game composites its menus, the 2D screen and the loading screen into
// each eye at the scene's render size (HMD Quality x the headset's size),
// before EDVR's upscale -- so at HMD Quality 0.65 a menu sampled from a
// 3840x2160 panel is rasterised into a 1995x1970 eye and then upscaled, and
// the adaptive UI evidence tells DLSS not to accumulate it. This takes those
// draws out of the eye: each is rasterised by the game's own shaders into
// an EDVR-owned per-eye layer at the size of the frame the door hands on
// (the upscaler's output, the unit-quality size under DLSS) times the key's
// target, unjittered, and the layer is composited over the finished eye
// after the upscale and RCAS, before EDVR's own menu. The UI therefore
// never reaches the upscaler's input: it cannot swim or ghost, and the UI
// depth re-issue and the reactive mask are skipped for the draws it takes.
//
// WHAT IT TAKES (phase 1): the post-tonemap composites -- the 2D screen's
// composite (recognised the way the panel distance and the curved screen
// recognise it, srv0IsPanelSized) except while that screen IS the world --
// on foot, or a 3D map -- where it stays in the picture for the temporal
// pass (the world-screen gate, ui_layer_math.h: the journal's on-foot
// reading OR the screen's own busy depth), and every eye draw that samples an
// interface surface ui_depth has learned (the menu / modal panel family,
// the loading screen's composite, the rest), into an 8-bit UNORM eye
// target, with a blend that has a premultiplied or multiplicative form.
// Depth and stencil: a draw that WRITES them (the menu panel marks its
// footprint in stencil for the draws after it) draws its colour into the
// layer and is issued once more with no colour target, so the write lands
// in the game's own buffer exactly as before; a draw that TESTS them is
// drawn against the layer's own depth-stencil target, the game's resampled
// to the layer's size with the jitter cancelled. A multiply (the loading
// screen's gamma pass) scales the layer and a per-channel transmittance the
// composite applies to the frame. WHAT IT LEAVES: the cockpit's holo
// panels, flight HUD and target sprite, which the game draws into the lit
// HDR target before exposure and the tonemap -- they stay in the picture the
// upscaler reconstructs, steadied by the UI depth and the reactive mask, and
// the layer, composited after the tonemap, cannot take them without
// transcribing it. Every family it leaves is named in the log with the
// reason.
//
// THE ORDER IT CHANGES, and the only one: a draw after a redirected draw
// that WRITES the same eye target is taken into the layer too, after the
// UI, so it stays where the game drew it -- over the UI. Two things still
// land under it as before: a post pass (it samples an eye-sized input) and
// a write the take path refuses at issue. A draw that only READS the
// target is never taken; it no longer sees the UI in what it reads. The
// totals line counts every case and names each shader pair once.
