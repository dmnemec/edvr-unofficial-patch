// immune to a tool writing that shared table -- measured 2026-08-18) or does
// a wrapper like ReShade (InPlace, because swapping a wrapper's object vptr
// is issue #6)?
//
// Defined in d3d11_proxy.cpp, which owns the system module handle. Returns
// InPlace when the module or context is unavailable: the mode that never
// breaks a stranger is the safe default.
//
// DECIDED ONCE PER DEVICE, in hookDevice, and passed to BOTH context
// installers. It must not be computed twice: the probe samples live vtable
// entries and the runtime re-points a few of them between two calls (measured
// 96/96 one call, 93/96 the next in one session), so two independent
// decisions could straddle the threshold and land on OPPOSITE modes for the
// SAME context -- one swapping the vptr while the other patches the table it
// just orphaned. Sharing one answer removes the straddle entirely.
