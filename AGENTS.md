# EDVR — working notes for coding agents

This is the only instructions file in the repo. CLAUDE.md is a one-line @AGENTS.md import because Claude Code reads only CLAUDE.md; do not add content there.

Unofficial VR fixes for Elite Dangerous: Odyssey. A proxy DLL
(`d3d11.dll` beside the game) and EDVR's own OpenXR runtime for
Elite (`openvr_api.dll` in `Openvr\win64`), a config file, and an
installer that carries all three.

The expensive resource on this project is not tokens, it is **test
flights**. Every wrong hypothesis costs a build, an install, a headset
session and a log. Everything below exists to spend fewer of them.

## Shell

Use the **PowerShell tool**, not Bash. Windows PowerShell 5.1: no `&&` or
`||` (use `;` and `if ($?)`), no ternary, no `??`. Don't redirect a native
exe's stderr with `2>&1` — 5.1 wraps each line in an ErrorRecord and sets
`$?` false on a clean exit.

`build.bat` must be launched **by absolute path**; a `cmd` invocation that
never ran the batch still exits 0, which has read as a successful build.

## Reading at low token cost

Every tool call re-sends the whole context, so anything read into it is
paid for again on every later call. Measured 2026-09-15: a 359-call
session averaged 427k tokens per call and never compacted.

- **Never read a large file whole.** `edvr.ini` (148 KB), `build.bat`
  (94 KB), `README.md`, `vscreen.cpp`, `temporal_pass.cpp` and most docs
  are far past the 30 KB line. Grep for the key or symbol, then read a
  range with the Read tool's offset and limit. A whole-file dump through
  PowerShell is not a way to read a file.
- **An investigation doc starts with a `## Status` block** of at most 60
  lines: state, open hypotheses, ruled-out pointer, next flight. Read the
  block first and go into the journal only where it points. Update the
  block whenever the doc changes; add one to any doc that lacks it.
- **Keep new docs small.** Append a dated entry to the arc's own doc
  rather than starting another review doc; a review that must be its own
  file stays under about 15 KB.
- **Delegate to subagents on the cheapest model that will do the job
  well.** Research, exploration and implementation go to a subagent, and
  only its conclusion comes back, so the main context stays small. Pick
  the tier by the task: mechanical, fully specified work with a check at
  the end (a reflow, an install and verify, a log read, a rename) goes to
  the cheapest tier; work needing judgment across files or a build gate
  goes to a mid tier; the top tier stays in the main context for diagnosis
  and decisions, where a wrong call costs a test flight. If a cheaper tier
  fails its check or reports doubt, rerun on the next tier up with its
  report attached rather than finishing by hand in the main context. Do
  not delegate a job of two or three tool calls: a subagent's own overhead
  exceeds it.
- Memory topic files point at the doc; they never mirror its journal.

## The sanctioned tools

These four operations go through `tools\`, and **only** through `tools\`.
Each was an ad-hoc one-liner retyped once a session for a month; the
evidence is the dozens of backups in both game directories named six
different ways, and a live `edvr.ini` a stray PowerShell anchor once
corrupted. Do not regenerate the one-liner — extend the script.

| Operation | Use | Never |
|---|---|---|
| Install a build next to the game | `python tools\install_edvr.py` | `Copy-Item` onto the game directory |
| Check the install matches the build | `python tools\install_edvr.py --verify-only` | eyeballing timestamps |
| Find and read a flight log | `python tools\edvr_log.py` (census aggregate: add `--tally vh [--frame N]`) | `Get-Content -Tail` + `Select-String` |
| Reflow release notes or docs | `python tools\reflow_notes.py` | reflowing by hand or by regex |

```bash
python tools\install_edvr.py --target steam --dry-run
python tools\install_edvr.py --target steam
python tools\edvr_log.py --target steam --expect-build HEAD --version
```

Anything that writes files takes `--dry-run`, and `--dry-run` **writes
nothing at all** — no copies, no backups, no directories. This project has
already shipped a `--dry-run` that wrote files; the self-tests assert the
property directly.

Every tool in `tools\` carries `--self-test`, and `build.bat` gates on it.
A new tool gets one too, and gets added to that gate — a parser that
drifts from the format it reads must fail in the build, not in the ten
minutes after a flight finally reproduced the effect being chased.

## Diagnosis discipline

- **Never ship a fix on an untested hypothesis.** State the hypothesis,
  name the specific log line, draw call, counter or struct field that
  would confirm or refute it, and get that evidence before editing code.
- **The first question about any flight log is whether it is the right
  build.** `python tools\edvr_log.py --target steam --expect-build HEAD`
  exits 2 when it is not. A log from a stale DLL is not evidence, and
  counters read off one have cost a session before.
- **When a flight refutes a hypothesis, write it down** as a one-line
  `ruled out: X, because Y` in the investigation doc under `docs\`, before
  proposing the next one. These arcs run for days across separate
  sessions; an idea that is not recorded as dead gets re-proposed.
- **Prefer root causes to compensation.** Do not propose sharpening,
  contrast tweaks, dead bands or threshold nudges to mask a geometry,
  motion-vector or timing bug. Sharpening over DLSS blur was proposed once
  and rightly rejected: the motion vectors were wrong.
- **Enumerate before you build.** When several causes are plausible, list
  them with a discriminating log signature for each and instrument them
  together, so one flight can eliminate several. One flight per hypothesis
  is the most expensive way to run this project.
- **State the environment a rendering fix depends on**: VR runtime
  (OpenVR / Oculus LibOVR / OpenXR), headset and per-eye render size,
  DLSS version, and any fixed-size internal table. A supporter's Elite
  using the Oculus native SDK meant four OpenVR-side fixes were inert on
  their rig and nothing said so.

## Build and verify before commit

- **Every C++ edit compiles before you report it as done.** Run the full
  `build.bat` by absolute path and read the tail of its output.
- The normal `build.bat` path is the validation build: it runs the Python
  self-tests, compiles the production DLLs, runs the test rigs, builds and
  checks the self-contained installer, and writes
  `build\full_build_receipt.json` only after all gates pass. Green means
  green; do not report success off a build you did not read.
- After that full build, commit the same source tree. For the install-only
  rebuild that gives the DLLs the clean commit's version, use
  `build.bat --dll-only` by absolute path. It requires a clean working tree
  and a matching full-build receipt, rebuilds and validates the production
  DLLs, and skips the test rigs and self-contained installer. It is a
  promotion step, never a substitute for validating changed source; if its
  receipt check fails, run the full build again.
- After editing, re-read the changed region for the things that have bitten
  here: declaration order, a duplicated census or log string, a shader
  entry-point name collision that would silently disable a new instrument.
- **Trace a new instrument end to end before flying it.** A summary path
  that set its finished flag before calling the report was dead on
  arrival; a fix that returned early shadowed the probe meant to measure
  it, and cost a flight. Ask what would appear in the log if the new code
  never ran, and make sure that is distinguishable from success.
- **Every test build must include an actionable flight test checklist.**
  Whenever you produce or promote a build ready for flight testing, you
  must provide the pilot a concrete checklist:
  1. Exactly what has to be tested in that version.
  2. Exactly how to test it (in-game scenarios, locations, required settings,
     and specific head movements or actions to perform).
  3. The positive and negative signals to look for (the precise visual cues,
     motion responses, or log signatures that confirm success or indicate
     failure).

## Editing config and INI files

- **Never edit a live `edvr.ini` with a regex or a PowerShell anchor.**
  Read it, edit it with the Edit tool, diff before and after. A bad anchor
  has corrupted Sean's working config.
- `edvr.ini` in a game directory carries the settings of whoever flew
  last. A reinstall does not undo an edit to it. `install_edvr.py` does not
  touch it unless `--ini` says so, and backs it up when it does.
- Settings mirror to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EDVR\<leaf>-<store>\` and are restored
  from there, because a game update once wiped the whole install directory
  including the ini.
- **Config values name the functionality, never the mechanism.** A key
  says what the user gets — `on`, `off`, `auto` — not the name of the
  technique inside.

## Scope control

- **Do not remove or rename a feature or config key without quoting the
  exact key and its current behaviour and asking first.** Similar names
  are easy to confuse: three separate things here share the word
  "witchspace", and only `fix.witchspace_stars` touches explosions. A
  removal was asked for, carried out against the wrong one, and reverted
  in the same turn.
- Do the work asked for. If something adjacent is worth fixing, say so;
  don't fold it in.

## Git

- Solo project: **branch, commit, merge to main, push.** No pull requests.
- **The task is not done until it is pushed.** After merging run
  `git push`, then `git log origin/main -1` and confirm the commit is
  actually there. A commit made and never pushed has been noticed from the
  other side more than once.
- **Write commit messages to a file and use `git commit -F`.** PowerShell
  5.1 does not escape embedded quotes when building a native command line,
  so a message with `"` in it splits into stray pathspecs. Write the file
  as UTF-8 without a BOM.
- Reading a file back to verify it: decode explicitly with
  `[Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes(path))`.
  `Get-Content` on a BOM-less UTF-8 file decodes as the ANSI codepage and
  turns every em-dash into mojibake — that reached a public GitHub comment
  once.
- Worktrees under `.claude\worktrees\` and `.Codex\worktrees\` share one
  stash stack with the main checkout. Never use bare `git stash` / `git
  stash pop`.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src\d3d11\` | the graphics half: hooks, shader fixes, the draw census |
| `src\openxr\` | the native OpenXR runtime: the OpenVR ABI Elite calls, translated to OpenXR |
| `src\openvr\compat\` | the OpenVR ABI header |
| `src\installer\` | the self-contained installer and its log bundler |
| `src\common\` | config, logging, the crash sentinel |
| `tools\` | Python tools, each with `--self-test`; C++ test rigs in subdirs |
| `docs\` | one investigation doc per arc — read its `## Status` block first |
| `build.bat` | full build, all gates; `--dll-only` is the receipt-guarded promotion path |
| `package.bat <version>` | builds, tests, then packages a release |
