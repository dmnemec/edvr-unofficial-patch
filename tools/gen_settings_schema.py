"""Generate the installer's settings schema, and enforce that it stays complete.

WHY THIS EXISTS

A settings window needs, for every setting: a type, a range, a default, the
choices where there are any, a short label and an explanation. All of that
already exists in this repository, in two places -- the accessor call in the
code says the type, the range and the default; the comment block above the key
in edvr.ini says what it does. Writing it down a THIRD time in C++ would create
another list to forget to update, which is exactly the failure
tools/check_config_contract.py exists to catch between the other two.

So the schema is generated from those two sources. A key read in several places
takes its type from the TYPED read -- getBool, getInt, getFloat -- and a
getString read of the same key beside one is the raw text for a log line or a
status echo, never a second opinion; two typed reads that disagree fail the
build (readers() says why). The only thing added by hand is the part neither
source can know: what to call the setting in a list,
and which value is RECOMMENDED (often the shipped default, sometimes not -- a
0.3 curve with a 0.7 distance is a tested pairing, and neither number is the
default). That lives in edvr.ini too, on one annotation line above the key:

    # ui: On-foot screen curve | recommended 0.3
    panel_curvature = 0.0

    # ui: Sun glare | choices vivid, realistic, stock
    sun_glare = vivid

    # ui: hidden -- the installer manages this one
    real_dll =

THE ENFORCEMENT

Every setting that is LIVE in edvr.ini -- uncommented, which is what promoting a
fix to shipped-on looks like -- must have one of those lines. A fix that gets
promoted and does not appear in the settings window is invisible to everybody
who does not read ini files, and nothing else in the build would notice: the
game reads it, the log names it, and the window that is supposed to expose it
simply does not. That is a build failure here.

Only [fix] is exposed. [advanced] and [experimental] are safety valves and
developer instruments -- the log names one when it wants you to change it, and
that is the only way anybody should arrive at them -- and the remaining sections
are plumbing named after the halves of EDVR that read them. A ui: line outside
[fix] is an error, so the rule cannot drift by accident.

Commented-out expert settings inside [fix] are not required to have one.
Annotate one and it appears; leave it and it stays where it is, which is the
right default for a developer instrument.

THE IN-HEADSET MENU (docs/settings-menu.md) is the second consumer, and it
reads the same annotations. A `menu` token on a [fix] setting's ui: line puts
that row on the menu's Fixes page; `menu performance` puts it on the
Performance page. A [fix] row with no token stays desktop-only. The menu's
developer tier shows every [advanced] and [experimental] key the code reads,
with no annotation at all: a getBool read is a switch, a bounded number is a
number, and a getString read is read-only unless a `# dev: choices a, b, c`
line above it names its values (the mirror of ui:, allowed only OUTSIDE
[fix]). `# dev: hidden` keeps a key off the menu entirely.

The menu's restart flagging is derived here too, from the same prose the
window reads: a menu row on the Fixes or Performance page that does not say
when it takes effect is a build error (as for the window); a developer-tier
key that does not say is a WARNING, listed, and the row wears a "?" badge
until the sentence is written.

A `headset` token says the value is a PER-HEADSET LIST -- `runtime/system:value`
entries separated by commas, as fix.openxr_resolution and the field-of-view
trims carry -- so `range` on the same line bounds one entry's value rather than
the string. The in-headset menu shows and edits the entry for the headset being
worn, and this window edits the raw list as text, because on the desktop nothing
knows which headset that is:

    # ui: Trim view, top and bottom | range 0..30 | headset | live | menu performance
    fov_trim_vertical =

    A key is read in more than one place more often than not, and not always
    with the same accessor. Only a typed read (getBool, getInt, getFloat and
    their InRange forms) says what the value is; a getString read beside one
    is the raw text for a log line or a status echo. So the typed read wins,
    whichever file is walked first -- and the walk order is what used to
    decide it. The menu's status page reads fix.render_sharpness with
    getString to echo the file's own text, from a file that sorts before the
    pass reading it with getFloat, and that made the window's Sharpening row
    a text box. A percentage row that is a text box takes "20" as 20 and
    shows it as 2000%, which is how it reached the field (issue 35).

    Among typed reads of one kind, the one that declares a range wins: an
    InRange read clamps the value to its bounds, so those are the bounds a
    box may show. A plain getInt in the first file walked used to hide the
    getIntInRange in the next -- fix.vscreen_res_width, read plain by the
    panel patch and bounded 640..8192 by the intro upscaler -- and the window
    showed bounds only because the annotation repeated them by hand.

    Two typed reads that disagree -- on the kind (getInt in one file, getFloat
    in another) or on the declared range -- are a real conflict, returned for
    the caller to fail the build on rather than pick one: the window would be
    typing into a box the code reads another way.
