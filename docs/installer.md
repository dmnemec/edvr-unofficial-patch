# The installer

`edvr-installer.exe` — one executable, carrying the native graphics/runtime
pair, `openxr_loader.dll`, its license notice, `edvr.ini` and optional NVIDIA
DLSS runtime as resources. It finds the game, installs or updates EDVR,
preserves the settings you have changed, keeps other mods working, and can put
everything back.

This file is why it does what it does. Using it is one paragraph in the
[README](../README.md).

## Why it exists

The manual install is five steps: place the native pair and bundled loader,
preserve the original OpenVR DLL, and keep any existing graphics-mod chain.

**Preserve the game's original `openvr_api.dll` for uninstall.** EDVR provides
the compatibility entry points itself and sends frames to native OpenXR. It
does not load the original library. Keeping that original lets uninstall
restore the game without requiring launcher file verification.

**One `d3d11.dll` name, several mods that want it.** EDHM installs as
`d3d11.dll`. So does anything built on 3Dmigoto. Copying EDVR's file over it
uninstalls the other mod silently — nothing reports an error, the other mod's
effects are simply gone. The fix is a rename plus one line in `edvr.ini`, which
is fine as an instruction and unreliable as a habit.

The installer validates the supported Elite executable profile and native
payload before writing. An unsupported profile fails closed instead of choosing
a legacy OpenVR or LibOVR route.

## Finding the game

Nothing is guessed from a fixed path. Each store is asked in its own terms:

| Store | Asked | Then |
|---|---|---|
| Steam | `HKCU\Software\Valve\Steam\SteamPath`, then every library in `steamapps\libraryfolders.vdf` | `steamapps\common\Elite Dangerous\Products\*` |
| Epic | `%ProgramData%\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests\*.item` (`InstallLocation`) | `<location>\Products\*` |
| Frontier | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Frontier_Developments`, the uninstall registry (both views), and `Frontier\EDLaunch` on every fixed drive | `<root>\Products\*` |

Every answer is then **confirmed by finding `EliteDangerous64.exe`**, and
anything that fails that test is not offered. A folder the user browses to goes
through the same confirmation. Odyssey products sort first, since that is what
EDVR is for. Three storefronts on one machine is not unusual, so when more than
one install is found the window pre-selects the one that already has EDVR in
it.

The `Openvr` folder is found by **file, not by name**: `Openvr\win64`, then
`Openvr`, then the game folder, and whichever holds `openvr_api.dll` *or*
`openvr_api_orig.dll` is the one. Both layouts are in the field, and after an
install the renamed original is the only openvr file with a familiar name.

## Whose file is this?

Every decision below depends on telling EDVR's DLLs from the game's, from
another mod's. That question is answered by **mapping the file read-only and
parsing its export table** — never by loading it. Loading a stranger's
`d3d11.dll` to ask what it is runs that stranger's `DllMain` inside the
installer, and the file we are least sure about is exactly the one we would be
executing.

The discriminator is the same one `tools/gen_exports.py` uses to refuse
building a proxy of a proxy: **an EDVR build exports `edvr_*` symbols** and
nothing else in this world does. It is tested first and unconditionally — an
EDVR proxy also exports everything the DLL it stands in for exports, so testing
for `VR_InitInternal` or `D3D11CreateDevice` first would file every one of our
own installs as the thing it replaced, and the installer would rename our proxy
aside believing it had found the game's original.

`VERSIONINFO` then gives a foreign file a name — ReShade, 3Dmigoto (which is
what EDHM ships), or DXVK — which is both what the report calls it and what it
gets renamed to (`d3d11_edhm.dll`). An unrecognised one becomes
`d3d11_other.dll` rather than being called by a name it might not deserve.

## The two halves

**`d3d11.dll`**, in the game folder:

| What is there | What happens |
|---|---|
| nothing | ours is written |
| ours, same build | left alone (Repair rewrites it anyway) |
| ours, older | backed up, replaced |
| another mod | backed up, renamed `d3d11_<mod>.dll`, ours takes the name, `advanced.real_dll` points at it |
| another mod, and we were installed here before | the same, reported as "it has replaced EDVR's d3d11.dll" |
| another mod, and its own older copy is already parked under that name | the older copy goes to the backup folder, the newcomer takes its place in the chain |
| unreadable (locked, or not a PE) | nothing is touched, and the report says why |

A chain target that has gone away — the other mod was uninstalled properly —
clears `advanced.real_dll` rather than leaving it naming a file that is not
there. That question is asked on every run, including one that does not touch
`d3d11.dll` at all.

Repair is for when another mod's installer overwrites EDVR's files. A common
case is EDHM's uninstaller running `del d3d11.dll`, which after an EDVR install
deletes *ours*. Repair puts both back, side by side.

**Native `openvr_api.dll` and the preserved original**, in `Openvr\win64`:

| current | `openvr_api_orig.dll` | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| absent | absent or present | native runtime is written; an existing original is preserved for uninstall |
| ours | present | native update; original remains untouched |
| ours | absent | native update proceeds; uninstall will require a recoverable original |
| game/OpenComposite runtime | absent | backed up, renamed to the original slot, then replaced by native OpenXR |
| newer game runtime | older original | both are backed up; the newer runtime becomes the uninstall original |
| another readable library | any | backed up before native installation; an existing original is preserved |
| unreadable destination | any | installation is refused before writing |

The native package does not require or select OpenComposite. The Windows Active
OpenXR Runtime is selected by the bundled Khronos loader, which the installer
places beside the native runtime. It does not search for or load a SteamVR or
vendor loader.

## Keeping your settings

An update ships a new `edvr.ini`: new settings, new defaults, rewritten
explanations. Copying it over the installed one throws away every value tuned
in a headset. Leaving the installed one in place means new settings arrive
undocumented and a changed default never reaches anybody. Both are silent, and
the second is worse, because the file still looks right.

So the installer keeps a copy of the shipped default of the version it
installed, in `edvr_install\edvr.ini.base`, and does a **three-way merge**. The
output is the new file, line for line, with your values written back into it:

| Your file vs the version you had | Result |
|---|---|
| you changed a value | your value, in the new file's line |
| you enabled an expert setting (`#fss_res = 0` → `fss_res = 1`) | stays enabled, at your value |
| you never touched it | the new default, comments and all |
| you deleted the line | the new file's line, commented out |
| the setting no longer exists | carried to the end of its section, with a note |
| a key that was never ours | carried verbatim |
| the installer must set it (chaining) | forced, and reported as the installer's doing |

Afterwards it tells you which settings kept your value and which took the new
default.

Indentation, the shipped spelling of the key, the spacing around `=` and any
inline comment all survive a rewrite, so a diff against the shipped file stays
readable. The parser follows `src/common/config.cpp` exactly — sections, `#`
and `;`, inline comments needing whitespace in front, last value wins, BOM
skipped — because a merge that disagreed with the game's reader about which
value is live would write a file whose settings are not the ones it reports.

With no base copy (a hand-installed rig meeting the installer for the first
time) it falls back to comparing against the new defaults, which keeps
everything that differs. That over-preserves — a default that moved between
versions reads as an edit — and the report says so rather than pretending it
was a three-way merge. In that mode it does **not** infer deletions: a setting
your older file never had must arrive live, not commented out.

## The settings screen

The second tab is every EDVR setting, with what it does, the value it ships
with, and the range it will accept — edited there instead of in Notepad.
Changes are written straight into `edvr.ini`, keeping its layout and comments,
and the game re-reads that file about once a second, so there is no Apply
button: the change is live by the time the mouse is up.

**Under each control, one line: the word it is set to, and one link.** A switch
shows a position, not a word, and nothing else on the row says that on writes
`steady` and off writes `stock` — so that word sits underneath, quietly. Beside
it, and only when the value is not the recommended one, a single link: *reset*
where the recommendation is the shipped default, *try 0.7* where it is not (a
0.3 curve with a 0.7 distance is a tested pairing, and neither number is the
default). Only the link is clickable, and the pointer turns to a hand over it.

That line used to name the value instead — "use splash", in the link colour,
directly under a switch — and the field read it as a label for the switch's
state rather than as a button, then read "use auto" beside an auto/on/off
control as the control being wrong about itself. The whole line was one click
target too, recommendation and "default splash" together, so one line of two
phrases read as two links.

**The table is generated, not written.** `tools/gen_settings_schema.py` builds
it from the two places the facts already live:

- the **accessor call** in the code gives the type, the declared range and the
  compiled default (`getIntInRange("fix.remlok_line_angle", 46, 20, 60)`);
- the **comment block** above the key in `edvr.ini` gives the explanation, and
  its first sentence becomes the one-line summary in the row.

Writing that down a third time in C++ would be a fourth list to forget to
update — which is the failure `tools/check_config_contract.py` exists to catch
between the other two.

A key is usually read in more than one place, and not always the same way. The
*typed* read — `getBool`, `getInt`, `getFloat` — is the one that says what the
value is; a `getString` read of the same key beside it is the raw text wanted
for a log line or a status echo, and never overrides it. Among typed reads, one
that declares a range wins, because it is the read that clamps the value to
those bounds. Two typed reads that disagree, on the kind or on the range, fail
the build. The rule used to be "the first file walked wins", and that is how
the Sharpening row shipped as a text box for three releases: the in-headset
menu echoes `fix.render_sharpness` with `getString` from a file that sorts
before the pass reading it with `getFloat`, and a text box that shows
percentages wrote a typed `20` as `20` and showed it back as `2000%`
([#35](https://github.com/characterecho-sean/edvr-unofficial-patch/issues/35)).
The generator's `--self-test` holds that shape, and `build.bat` runs it before
generating.

What neither source can know is added by hand, on one annotation line above the
key: what to call the setting in a list, which value is recommended (usually
the default, sometimes a tested pairing like a 0.3 curve with a 0.7 distance),
the choices where the value is a word, and the bounds where they are documented
in prose rather than declared in code.

```ini
# ui: On-foot screen curve | recommended 0.3 | range 0..1
panel_curvature = 0.0

# ui: Sun glare | choices vivid, realistic, stock
sun_glare = vivid

# ui: Scanner: heal the black squares | choices 1=on, 2=both eyes, 0=off
fss_eye_heal = 1

# ui: hidden -- the installer sets this when it chains another mod
real_dll =
```

**Only `[fix]` is shown.** `[advanced]` and `[experimental]` are safety valves
and developer instruments — the log names one when it wants you to change it,
and that is the only way anybody should arrive at them; a list that offers them
invites changing things nobody asked you to change. The remaining sections
(`[hotkey]`, `[log]`, `[openvr]`, `[d3d11]`) are plumbing named after the
halves of EDVR that read them. A `ui:` line outside `[fix]` is a build error,
so the rule cannot drift by accident.

**Every row says when it takes effect.** Most settings are live — EDVR re-reads
`edvr.ini` about once a second — and those that are not are marked *restart the
game*: at present `share_exposure`, `transition_flash`, `openxr_resolution`,
and the two `vscreen_res_*` sizes. That fact is not a fourth list either: it
comes from what the comment block in `edvr.ini` already says ("Live." or the
sentence naming a restart), and a setting whose prose says neither fails the
build. Somebody who changes a setting and sees nothing happen otherwise has no
way to tell a fix that needs a restart from one that is not working.

**A setting that is live in `edvr.ini` must have one of those lines, or the
build fails.** Uncommenting a key is what promoting a fix to shipped-on looks
like, and a fix that ships on but never appears in the settings window is
invisible to everybody who does not edit ini files — while nothing else in the
build notices, because the game reads it, the log names it, and only the window
that was supposed to expose it is silent. `hidden` is a valid answer, with a
reason; forgetting is not. Commented-out expert settings are exempt: annotate
one and it appears, leave it and it stays where it is.

## Save logs

**Save logs** writes one zip to the Desktop: the most recent session's logs,
`edvr_breadcrumbs.txt`, any `edvr_FATAL.txt`, `edvr.ini` and the install
record. That is the list [Reporting a
problem](../README.md#reporting-a-problem) asks for — four things in three
folders, named in a paragraph somebody reads while annoyed — collected by the
program that is already open and already knows which folder the game is in and
where `log.dir` moved the logs to.

*Most recent session* is meant literally. EDVR names its logs
`edvr_<gfx|vr>_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` and writes two a few seconds apart at each
launch, so the newest stamp and everything within three minutes of it is one
session; older sessions are left out, because an attachment with six launches
in it is harder to read, not more informative. The stamp is taken from the
**name** rather than the write time, since copying a folder, restoring a backup
or unpacking somebody else's zip rewrites write times — all things that happen
to a folder on its way into a bug report.

The zip is written by hand (stored, not deflated) rather than by linking a
compression library or shelling out to PowerShell: logs are small, every tool
opens a stored zip, and the installer stays one file with nothing behind it. It
is the one action that stays available while the game is running, which is
exactly when somebody wants it. `--collect-logs` does the same from the command
line. Planned enhancements (including bundling flat `shaders/` diagnostic
dumps, post-crash alert banners, and active process guards) are documented in
[diagnostic-reporting-automation-2026-09-26.md](diagnostic-reporting-automation-2026-09-26.md).


## Doing it safely

- **Nothing happens without a yes.** The plan is worked out in full, shown, and
  confirmed before a file moves. Both confirmations default to *No*, because
  Install is the window's default push button and two stray Return presses at a
  window that has just taken focus should not be able to modify a game folder.
- **A stale plan does nothing.** The plan records what each file was when it
  was made; if any of them changed while the confirmation was open — another
  installer ran, a game update landed, a second copy of this window did the job
  — the run is refused before the first step rather than executed against a
  folder it no longer describes.
- **Names that come from `edvr.ini` are checked to be names.**
  `advanced.real_openvr_dll` ends up as a rename destination, and a value with
  a path in it would move the game's runtime somewhere else entirely while the
  report said otherwise. Anything that is not a plain sibling filename falls
  back to the default.
- **Everything replaced is copied into `edvr_backup\<timestamp>\` first.** That
  is also what makes a lost `openvr_api_orig.dll` recoverable later.
- **A failed step rolls the run back.** Each step records its own undo, and
  rollback restores the bytes of files that were replaced or deleted. Writes go
  to a temp file and are moved into place, so a failure part-way cannot leave a
  truncated DLL where a working one was.
- **Uninstall never leaves the folder without an `openvr_api.dll`.** If the
  game's original is missing it is restored from an EDVR backup, and if there
  is no backup either, ours stays where it is with an explanation — removing it
  would be worse than leaving it.
- **The install record is written last**, so a run interrupted half way leaves
  the previous one, which still describes the folder better than a half-true
  new one.
- **`asInvoker`.** A Steam library on another drive needs no elevation;
  demanding it every time trains people to click through a UAC prompt they did
  not need. When a folder does need it, the installer says so and relaunches
  itself already confirmed. It asks for administrator rights only if the game
  is under `Program Files`, and only when it reaches that step.
- **The game must be closed**, and it says which it is rather than failing on a
  locked file halfway through. *This* game: the running `EliteDangerous64.exe`
  is asked where it was launched from, and only a copy running out of the
  folder being installed into stops the run. A machine with two installs — a
  Frontier launcher one and a Steam one — plays one while the other is patched,
  and a refusal that went by the executable's name alone stopped the folder
  nobody was in. The other install being up is said out loud rather than passed
  over in silence. A process whose path cannot be read at all counts as this
  one, since a refusal is the direction somebody can recover from.

## NVIDIA's DLSS runtime

`temporal_aa = dlaa` and `dlss` hand each frame to NVIDIA's history, which
lives in `nvngx_dlss.dll`. The driver does not ship that file (on the rig this
was built on the driver store holds the NGX loader and the frame-generation
library, and NGX keeps an over-the-air model cache under
`ProgramData\NVIDIA\NGX`, but no super-resolution runtime), so the application
has to carry it, and the DLSS SDK licence allows exactly that: the runtime may
be distributed as incorporated into an application, not as a stand-alone
download. So it rides inside the installer, unmodified, and is placed beside
the game's executable, where NGX looks for it, under three rules. Only where an
NVIDIA adapter is present, by DXGI's vendor id (a machine with an AMD
integrated GPU beside an RTX card counts): it is 59 MB, and on any other card
the pass falls back to its own history regardless. Only when the slot is empty
or holds the copy a previous EDVR install placed: a copy you put there
yourself, or one NVIDIA's updater replaced, is left alone, and the report says
so. And uninstall removes only the copy EDVR placed, by the hash in the install
record. A build made without the DLSS SDK ships an installer without the
runtime, and says so in its window and its report.

## What it does not do

No network access of any kind: it installs what it carries, and "update" means
running the newer installer. No telemetry. No registry writes — the registry is
only read, to find the game. No Add/Remove Programs entry, no shortcuts, no
services, no scheduled tasks. Nothing outside the game folder, `edvr_backup\`
and `edvr_install\`.

## The command line

The window is the product; the command line is what makes it testable and
scriptable.

```
edvr-installer.exe --install [--dir D] [--dry-run]
edvr-installer.exe --repair [--dir D]
edvr-installer.exe --uninstall [--dir D] [--remove-settings]
edvr-installer.exe --collect-logs [--dir D]
edvr-installer.exe --help
```

`--replace-settings` does what it says. Without `--dir` it finds the installs
itself and refuses to guess when there is more than one. `--dry-run` prints the
plan and touches nothing. It is a GUI-subsystem program, so a command-line run
borrows the calling console; run it with `start /wait` if the interleaved
prompt bothers you.

## How it is built and tested

`build.bat` builds the native graphics/runtime pair before the installer.
`tools/gen_installer_rc.py` validates the native graphics marker/providers,
native runtime exports, bundled loader and notice before generating resources.
A missing or mismatched native resource fails the build; there is no half-patch
installer. The linker's own manifest is turned off with `/MANIFEST:NO` — two
`RT_MANIFEST` resources in one image is a program Windows refuses to start.

The installed game's exact executable profile is checked separately by the
installer before any mutation.

`tools/installer_test` is the reason the planner is a pure function of a survey
of the folder. Every case worth getting right is a state of somebody else's
machine — EDHM in the `d3d11.dll` slot, another mod's installer having
overwritten ours, a game update that put the stock `openvr_api.dll` back, an
original lost to a double rename, an `edvr.ini` full of tuned values — and none
of them can be produced to order on the machine doing the build. They are all
written down there instead, along with an end-to-end install, uninstall and
rollback against real files in a scratch folder.

Two guards exist because the failure they catch is invisible: the resource
generator refuses a manifest that is not valid XML, and the build runs the
finished installer with `--help` and fails if it does not start. A bad manifest
links perfectly and dies before `main()`.
