# Anti-aliasing and the shimmer: a design

## Status

*Restates the journal below; not new evidence -- update it whenever
this doc changes. Last updated 2026-09-25 for the camera rows after a
drop.*

- **State:** TAA/DLSS carries UI/smoke depth and station motion by
  default ("Current defaults", 2026-09-10). Feature A (the supersample
  resolve) is RETIRED 2026-09-16: field-verified on the legacy OpenVR
  proxy, never called on the native runtime, removed with its key; its
  eye-region rule stays in `supersample_math.h`. Feature B (temporal
  AA, DLAA/DLSS) is built and flown near-daily since 2026-09-02 (2.80
  -> 2.02 ms/eye on 09-06); the own resolve's lean variant is BUILT,
  NOT FLOWN (2026-09-16). C and D remain sketches; the rest lock shipped
  09-03, retired 09-04. 2026-09-23: the DLSS ladder walk no longer
  breaks on a failed query; that evening's modes line showed the floor
  is real, and the door's output now follows an input under it (twice
  the input, the runtime upsampling the rest) instead of DLSS standing
  aside -- BUILT, NOT FLOWN ("The served floor", at the end).
- **Open:**
  - The world path's rows after a drop: a parked camera's zero was
    accepted as the view's delta and carried (eye run 050423). The gate
    now refuses it. BUILT 2026-09-25, NOT FLOWN; its own doc is
    camera-rows-carry-2026-09-25.md.
  - The served floor: 0.5 FLOWN 16:27 (f05c84bf), not exercised (exactly
    on the floor: 2037x1969 -> 4074x3938 at 50%, standard scaling); 0.45
    still owed; signature in "The served floor".
  - Features C and D: unbuilt. DLSS/FSR 2 as default engines (Phasing
    step 6): not phased in; the every-vendor design is
    fsr-upscaler-design-2026-09-16.md (AMD has no D3D11 backend).
  - The 2026-09-04 far-warp/darkness review's four fixes and that
    evening's five-lever cleanup: "Unflown as of the commit."
  - Phase 0 items 1, 7, 8, 9, 11 (AA-option census, HUD legibility under
    jitter, crop edges, feature D's passes, foveation reach).
  - `shimmer_rest_still`/`_moving` past the Quest 3's tracker floor:
    left as "the next flight's question" at retirement. The lean own
    shader's price: one flight, `advanced.temporal_aa_diagnostics` live.
- **Ruled out:**
  - MSAA from outside a deferred renderer: structurally unreachable.
  - Conservative rasterisation for the menu-ship seam: flown 2026-09-03,
    reverted the same day (no effect, new artifacts).
  - The rest lock (`shimmer_rest`): retired 2026-09-04 (TAA integrates
    the wander; it never engaged on the Quest 3's tracker). Five TAA
    levers (2026-09-04 cleanup): the rest snap, HUD depth layers, the
    assumed HUD distance, `camera` motion, the transposed-reading A/B.
  - Full per-object motion matrices: declined (per-object-motion.md).
  - Feature A on the native runtime: not ported (the submit blit
    minifies an oversize eye with one bilinear tap, d3d11_stereo.cpp).
  - A failed mid-ladder query hiding the mode that serves a 40% input
    (the 2026-09-23 hardening's cause): the 15:34 modes line answered
    all four, and no mode serves between a third and a half.
- **Environment:** Native SteamVR is measured; OpenComposite's OpenXR
  leg is unverified. Pimax Crystal Super (~42 px/deg, tracking floor
  0.53 arcmin/frame) vs. Quest 3 (~20-40.6 px/deg, never under 1.9).
  Eye texture `R8G8B8A8_TYPELESS`, linear; depth reversed-Z (0.025..
  50000 scene, 0.1..1000 elsewhere). DLSS/DLAA need an RTX GPU and the
  NGX runtime (field rig: RTX 5090); per output, NGX serves half to full
  size in three modes and a single point at a third in the fourth.
- **Detail:** "What EDVR already owns" has the shared hooks; "Feature
  A"/"Feature B" each feature's mechanism, settings and flight log;
  "Considered and declined" and the rest lock the retired ideas;
  "Phase 0" the unmeasured; "Phasing" the build order. Linked:
  performance.md, per-object-motion.md, rest-lock-handoff.md, and the
  two 2026-09-04 reviews (motion vectors; far-warp darkness).

## The ask

*A design document, written before the code, as a companion to
[performance.md](performance.md). Claims about EDVR cite the source; claims
about the game, runtimes and SDKs are labelled measured (established in this
repo's field logs or code), vendor-stated (their documentation or release
notes), or believed; what can only be settled at implementation time or in a
live session is collected under Phase 0. Feature A's passive mode was built
on 2026-09-02, field-verified on both rigs by 2026-09-03 on the legacy OpenVR
proxy, shipped `auto` then `off`, and was retired on 2026-09-16 — its
section is the record of what was built and measured; everything
else here is design.*

Two questions, asked together. The anti-aliasing Elite offers is widely
held to be bad, worst of all in a headset — could EDVR supply its own MSAA
when the player turns the game's off? And more broadly: what can be done
about the shimmer VR players see?

**The ask, verbatim from the field:** *"some way to attack the shimmering
via some custom post processing — guess that's what ReShade is for, but
nice if it would be part of EDVR. A super-tuned processing just to tackle
the shimmering we all see so much of. A kind of Elite-specific anti-shimmer
effect. Could we do something like this performantly?"* It came with a
proposal worked out elsewhere: pull the game's real view and projection
matrices out of its constant buffers, the way the from-scratch upscaler
injections do for games with no native upscaler, combine them with the
depth buffer into exact motion vectors for camera motion and static
geometry, and accept that independently moving objects — other ships,
station rings, planets — would need their per-object matrices too, which
is per-game reverse engineering that breaks on engine updates; "a real
project, not a shader tweak". That proposal is answered under
[The field's proposal](#the-fields-proposal-motion-vectors-from-the-games-own-matrices):
it is the right shape, it is feature B below, and EDVR already holds
most of what it needs.

The short answers, argued below:

- **MSAA: no.** Not "hard" — unavailable, from outside a deferred
  renderer, for reasons that do not move. What MSAA is *for* (more samples
  per pixel) is reachable from outside in exactly one form, supersampling,
  and EDVR can do that better than it is done today (feature A).
- **The shimmer is a temporal problem, and the game has no temporal
  anti-aliasing.** Every option in Elite's menu is a post-process edge
  filter (believed; Phase 0 checks it), which by construction cannot touch
  sub-pixel flicker. The feature that addresses the complaint is a
  temporal anti-aliasing pass at submit (feature B), and EDVR already owns
  every hook it needs — including, unusually for an injected TAA, the
  per-frame projection edit that gives it a real sub-pixel jitter.
- Two small levers (a texture LOD bias, feature C; a sharpen, already
  designed) and one shader-level one (specular anti-aliasing in the
  lighting resolve, feature D) round it out.
- Until any of that ships, there is guidance the README and `edvr.ini` can
  carry today, under [Guidance for players now](#guidance-for-players-now).

## What the shimmer is, and why an edge filter cannot touch it

A rendered pixel is one sample of the scene. Anything narrower than a pixel
— a station's girders, the HUD's hairlines and text, the specular glint on
a hull panel, the noise of a detail map on terrain, a distant ship — is
either hit by that sample or missed by it, and which one changes as the
sample grid moves over the scene. On a monitor the grid moves when the
camera does. In a headset it never stops moving: the head is never still,
pixels are large in degrees (the field Quest 3 renders 1456 pixels across
a 94° horizontal frustum at the eye size it measured over Steam Link —
about fifteen per degree; `compositor_hook.cpp` and `system_hook.cpp`),
and the eye is drawn to motion. That is the shimmer — content flickering
on and off the grid, frame after frame.

Post-process anti-aliasing (FXAA, SMAA, MLAA and their relatives) runs on
the *finished* image. It finds edges among pixels that have already been
resolved and blends along them. It can smooth a staircase; it cannot know
that a girder existed between two samples, because nothing in its input
records that. Applied to shimmer, an edge filter turns flicker into
smoothly-blended flicker. This is why the field lore around Elite in VR —
"only HMD Quality does anything", "turn AA off and supersample" — is right:
the game's AA is not bad at what it does, it is the wrong kind for the
problem.

Only two things address sub-pixel flicker: more samples per pixel, or the
same samples integrated over time.

| Technique | What it samples | Where it must live | Reach from a proxy DLL |
|---|---|---|---|
| MSAA | extra coverage and depth samples per pixel, shading once | the rasterisation of every geometry pass, and the lighting that reads them | none — [below](#msaa-from-outside-and-why-the-answer-is-no) |
| SSAA (supersampling) | a bigger image, filtered down | any size answer plus a filter at the door | full — feature A |
| TAA (temporal) | the previous frames, reprojected | after rendering, before display | full — feature B |
| post-process (FXAA/SMAA/MLAA) | the finished image's edges | anywhere | full, and useless alone |

**What the game offers.** Elite's anti-aliasing menu offers Off, FXAA,
SMAA and the two MLX modes (MLX2, MLX4) — believed; the menu itself is the
check. All four are believed to be post-process filters of the same family
— none multisampled, none temporal — which is consistent with the field
lore above and with their near-zero cost. Frontier announced a fuller
anti-aliasing solution for Odyssey in 2021 and later cancelled it; none
has shipped since (believed, from the public record). Two things this
repo has measured bear on it, and both point the same way:

- The deferred lighting resolve reads its four geometry-buffer inputs with
  `ld_indexable` — ordinary `Texture2D` loads, not multisample loads
  (measured: `src/d3d11/resolve_probe.cpp`, from the shader's own
  disassembly).
- Nothing in this repo's field write-ups records a multisampled render
  target or a `ResolveSubresource` on the main view, though the census has
  recorded resolves as `V` lines since 2026-08-25 (`src/d3d11/vscreen.cpp`)
  and every copy path refuses `SampleDesc.Count > 1` with a log line that
  has never been reported. A limited claim — nobody was looking, and the
  AA setting those sessions ran is unrecorded — and the Phase 0 item that
  makes it a measurement is one flight with each menu option in turn.

## MSAA from outside, and why the answer is no

How MSAA works: at rasterisation the hardware tests coverage and depth at
several positions inside each pixel, runs the pixel shader once, and stores
one colour per *covered sample*; a resolve afterwards averages them. It
anti-aliases geometry edges, and only those. In a forward renderer that is
the whole story. In a deferred renderer — Elite's (measured: the frame is a
geometry buffer, a lighting resolve that reads it, an HDR image and a long
post chain, each twice; `src/d3d11/eye_split.cpp` and
`docs/scanner-body.md`) — the geometry buffer itself would have to be
multisampled, and every pass that reads it would have to read *per sample*
at edges and shade each one, or the edges come back aliased with the cost
already paid. Engines that do MSAA in deferred pipelines build it in from
the start, with edge-detection masks and per-sample lighting branches.

What a proxy could try is the transparent trick: at `CreateTexture2D`,
raise `SampleDesc.Count` on the eye-sized targets. It breaks four times
over:

1. **Views.** A shader-resource, render-target or depth view over a
   multisampled resource must be created with the `TEXTURE2DMS` view
   dimension; the game's `TEXTURE2D` views fail to create (vendor-stated,
   the D3D11 view rules). EDVR would have to rewrite every view
   description too.
2. **Shaders.** Every shader that reads those targets declares
   `Texture2D` and uses `ld`/`sample`; a multisampled resource needs
   `Texture2DMS` and `ld_ms` with a sample index. Those are the game's
   shaders — hundreds of them — and each one would need transcribing, the
   way the sun-glare and panel vertex shaders were, but for every reader in
   the post chain.
3. **The lighting.** Even with the reads fixed, the resolve shades once per
   pixel. Correct MSAA in a deferred renderer means per-sample shading at
   edges, which is a change to the game's lighting shader, not to its
   resource descriptions.
4. **Everything else the sixteen targets go through** — copies, the
   tonemap chain, the temporal reconstruction the scanner runs — would meet
   a resource kind it was never written for.

This is exactly the trick the graphics drivers' control-panel overrides
("enhance the application setting") perform, and it is exactly why those
overrides do nothing on deferred D3D11 titles — a known limitation, and the
same one that disqualifies NVIDIA's VRSS for this game (performance.md,
"What translates"). Elite's own MLX modes, if they were ever multisampled,
would be the engine doing this from inside; the menu's near-zero cost says
they are not.

**Where MSAA could be bolted on, and why it is declined.** One class of
draw is MSAA-able from outside: forward-rendered overlays — the holographic
HUD's lines and text, a genuine source of shimmer. Redirect those draws
(recognised by shader hash, the census's currency) into an EDVR-owned
multisampled target, with the scene's depth copied into a multisampled
depth buffer so the HUD still occludes correctly, resolve, and composite
back with the game's own blend. It is real machinery — a depth
replication pass, a redirected target per eye, a composite that must match
the game's blend state exactly — and it anti-aliases the HUD's edges only,
while features A and B below anti-alias the HUD *and* everything behind it
with none of that. Declined on those grounds, not on feasibility.

So: the honest answer to "our own MSAA" is no. What survives of the idea
is the half of it EDVR can actually do — more samples per pixel, by
rendering more of them and resolving them well.

## What EDVR already owns

The reason both real features are tractable:

- **The size answer.** `hookedGetRecommendedRenderTargetSize`
  (EDVR's native runtime) multiplies the size handed to the game,
  and the game rebuilds its targets as for any supersampling change
  (measured; the cull guard's stage 1). Feature A's render half is this
  hook with a factor above 1.0 — performance.md's `render_scale`, the
  other side of 1.0.
- **The projection edit, per frame.** Elite re-queries
  `GetProjectionRaw` and `GetProjectionMatrix` every frame (measured,
  ~1080 calls a second each), and the cull guard already edits both
  consistently — tangents in the raw thunk, the four tangent-carrying
  matrix elements in the member-shaped receiver, switched only at the
  frame boundary (EDVR's native runtime). A sub-pixel jitter is the same edit
  with a *shift* instead of a widening: `l`, `r`, `t`, `b` all moved by one
  small delta, and the matrix's `m02`/`m12` following from the shifted
  tangents exactly as they follow from the lied ones today. This is what
  makes feature B a real TAA rather than a temporal smoother.
- **The submit door.** `hookedSubmit` (EDVR's native runtime)
  already substitutes an EDVR-owned texture for the game's on three paths,
  with `applyCullGuard`'s discipline — one lambda, every forwarding path,
  no path ships an untreated frame. Both features are one more treatment
  inside that lambda.
- **Both sizes, in one DLL.** EDVR holds the size the runtime
  recommended (`trueSizeW/H`) and the size the game actually submitted per
  eye (`noteEyeTextureSize`, re-read every six seconds). Their ratio is
  the supersampling factor in force, whoever set it — Elite's HMD Quality
  or EDVR's own lie — and feature A keys on it directly.
- **The compute-pass shape.** `intro_upscale.cpp` runs a chain of compute
  passes (deband, EASU, RCAS) over textures at submit-adjacent points, with
  constants computed on the CPU and the HLSL desk-compiled before it ships.
  A resolve filter and a TAA pass are two more passes of that shape. RCAS
  — the sharpen that offsets any filter's softness — is vendored and running.
- **The depth buffer, identified.** The census records the depth view
  bound with every eye draw (`d=`, `docs/scanner-body.md`), the eye-split
  dump copies the "two depth-ish planes" per eye (`eye_split.cpp`), and
  the terrain work measured the convention: reversed-Z, near 1, far 50000
  (`system_hook.cpp`, `scanner-body.md`). Feature B's reprojection needs
  exactly this.
- **The camera, twice over.** The head pose at `WaitGetPoses` and the
  eye-to-head transform (observed on slot 4, never lied about) give the
  head's motion between frames; and the flash detector already reads the
  game's own camera buffer every frame, recognised by size
  (`src/d3d11/glitch_frame.h`) — the source for the *ship's* motion, which
  the head pose does not carry.
- **Single-threaded rendering** (measured: Submit and Present on one
  thread, no `ExecuteCommandList` ever seen), so both eyes' passes run
  sequentially on the immediate context from inside the submit hook.
- **Shader substitution by content hash**, including the lighting resolve
  itself — `resolve_probe.cpp` has already swapped that exact pixel shader
  for a replacement, for one draw, and put it back. Feature D is that
  mechanism with a different replacement.

## Feature A — supersample resolve at the door

*Retired 2026-09-16.* The legacy OpenVR proxy that called the resolve at
submit was removed that day (1a54e9e), and the native OpenXR runtime that
replaced it on 2026-09-14 never called it — the key had been inert since
the port. Rather than port it, the key, the pass (`supersample_pass.cpp`),
the export and the kernel arithmetic were removed;
`supersampleRegionFromBounds` in `supersample_math.h` stays as the
eye-region rule every door pass reads. What follows is the record of
what was built and measured.

**What it is.** When the game submits an eye image larger than the runtime
asked for, EDVR filters it down to exactly the recommended size itself, with
a kernel chosen for anti-aliasing, and submits that with full bounds. The
compositor then samples 1:1 through its distortion pass instead of
decimating a large texture on the fly.

**Why it is worth doing when supersampling already exists.** Today a
supersampled frame is filtered down by whoever runs the distortion pass.
SteamVR's default is a bilinear tap (believed — it is what performance.md
already relies on for the upscale direction), which at a factor of 2.0 is a
2×2 box and at 1.4 skips texels and aliases; its *Advanced Supersample
Filtering* option applies a better kernel, "less aliasing at the cost of a
slightly softer image", and by its own description needs a high resolution
value to notice (vendor-stated, the setting's text). Other OpenXR
runtimes get whatever filtering they do internally, which nobody here
has measured. EDVR's resolve is the same filter on every stack, its
kernel is a
setting rather than a fixed choice, the sharpen composes after it, and the
crop for the cull guard fuses with it — the argument feature 1 of
performance.md makes for the upscale direction, made for the downscale one.

**Mechanism.** Two modes of engagement, same pass:

1. *Passive (v1):* the submit hook sees per-eye size > recommended size and
   arms — no size lie, nothing new asked of the game. Whatever produced
   the supersampling (Elite's HMD Quality above 1.0, which scales the
   game's targets past the recommended size and leaves the downsample to
   the compositor — measured 2026-09-02 on the Pimax over native SteamVR:
   HMD Quality 1.25 submitted 6780x6695 per eye against a recommended
   5424x5356, exactly 1.25x on each axis, one texture per eye with null
   bounds) is left as it is; only the resolve changes hands.
2. *Active (v2):* `render_scale` above 1.0 tells the game the headset wants
   more pixels (the stage-1 size lie, measured to work) and the same pass
   resolves them back to native. EDVR then controls both ends: the player
   leaves HMD Quality at 1.0 and turns one knob, in the same place they
   turn it down for FSR. Adoption follows the guard's changed-size test,
   frames forward untouched until both eyes submit at the new size.

The kernel: a separable Gaussian in output-pixel units by default (calm,
never rings on the HUD's hairlines), with a Mitchell/Lanczos option for
players who prefer crisp over calm. RCAS after it, at
`render_sharpness`, recovers what the Gaussian softens. Both the crop and
the resolve take an input sub-rectangle, so guard+resolve is one dispatch
once the edge-tap subtlety performance.md already lists is settled.

**What it does and does not fix.** It is real anti-aliasing — the pixel
count is the anti-aliasing, and the filter is how much of it reaches the
eye — but the pixels still have to be rendered, which is the expensive
part players already pay. It is worth about one resolve's difference over
today's supersampling, not a new category. Its structural value is that it
is the door TAA walks through next, and that TAA over a supersampled input
is the best anti-aliasing available anywhere.

**Settings** (`[fix]`, the names as built; performance.md's `render_scale`
is not in this tree yet and is not invented here — the active mode waits
on it):

```
supersample_resolve = off    ; off (default) | auto | on. auto engages when
                             ; game submits larger than the runtime asked
                             ; for, however that came about, and stays
                             ; quiet otherwise; on is the same and says so
                             ; when it finds nothing to do. Live.
```

Pixel cost quoted the way performance.md quotes it: HMD Quality 1.4
renders ~196% of native pixels, and that is the game's price, paid
already. The pass's own price is measured by timestamp query and printed
in the graphics log; believed well under a millisecond per eye at headset
sizes until the field says otherwise.

**What was built (2026-09-02: the passive mode; `auto` by default since
2026-09-03).** `auto` stayed the shipped default until 6d22901
(2026-09-10, in v0.15.0) flipped it to `off`; see the Status block. The
openvr half decides (`src/openvr/supersample_resolve.cpp`). Every
forwarded submit's per-eye size — the texture's size narrowed by its
bounds, which is the post-crop size when the cull guard is live — is
judged at the frame boundary against the recommendation the system hook
captured (`systemHookRecommendedSize`): the resolve arms once both eyes
submit the same size, larger than the recommendation by more than
rounding (one percent or two pixels, whichever is larger), disarms on any
change of either size, and re-adopts at the same boundary when the new
size still qualifies, so a resolution change costs no untreated frame
(`src/common/supersample_math.h` holds the state machine and the kernel
maths, header-only, so a test drives them without a headset — the
guard's changed-size adoption discipline, mirrored). The d3d11 half
filters (`edvrSupersampleResolve`, `src/d3d11/supersample_pass.cpp`):
two compute dispatches per eye, horizontal then vertical through a
float16 intermediate, the taps clamped inside the eye's own region so
the other eye's half of the double-wide texture and any guard margin are
never read, gamma content decoded to linear light around the filter
(what the compositor's own sRGB view does — the same operation with a
better kernel, not a different one) and re-encoded after, into an
EDVR-owned texture of the recommended size in the source's own format,
submitted with full bounds in the original orientation. The treatment
runs on every forwarding path of `hookedSubmit` — the game's frame, the
guard's crop, the theater's rendering, the withhold's shadow — after the
guard's crop where one runs: crop first, resolve second, sequentially;
the fused dispatch is noted in the code as future work. Any refusal — a
one-file install (the theater's "mismatched pair?" voice), an unlisted or
sRGB-typed format, an MSAA or array source, a failed compile or view, a
spent fault budget — stands the resolve down for the session with one
line and forwards the game's own frame. The sharpen that seam waited for
is built (2026-09-03, after feature B's first flight): `render_sharpness`
runs AMD's RCAS as the last pass at the door, `src/d3d11/sharpen_pass.cpp`
behind `edvrSharpen`, on whatever the passes before it produced, its taps
clamped inside the eye's region the way the resolve's are. Pinned at the
desk by `tools/supersample_test` (both
kernels' weights sum to one on every output pixel, a flat image stays
flat at every width and ratio, taps never leave the region, the textbook
Mitchell values at width 2, the arm/disarm verdict frame by frame
including the double-wide and flipped bounds) and by `tools/smoke`,
which runs the pass on a real device against a double-wide source and
asserts no bleed across the seam.

**Corrected 2026-09-15.** The compositor hook's fallback string for
`experimental.supersample_resolve` — the value used only when the ini
lacks the key — was found still saying `auto`, missed by 6d22901, and
was corrected to `off` in `src/openvr/compositor_hook.cpp`. Changes
nothing on an install whose ini already carries the key.

What the log says, and which Phase 0 item each line answers:

- `supersample resolve: engaged -- each eye arrives at WxH against the
  runtime's recommended WxH (…x horizontal, …x vertical …)`, in the vr
  log: the detected ratio, the kernel and its radius.
- `supersample resolve: first resolved frame -- the game submits <format>
  (DXGI_FORMAT n) …`, in the graphics log: Phase 0 item 2, the submitted
  format and whether it is read as gamma.
- `supersample resolve: measured … ms per eye on average (max …)`, after
  120 timed passes, and the periodic `supersample resolve totals:` line:
  Phase 0 item 6's price half, by timestamp query.
- `supersample resolve STANDING DOWN: …` or `… stands down`, anywhere: a
  refusal, with its reason.

**First flight (2026-09-02, Pimax Crystal Super over native SteamVR,
`on`, the cull guard live at h 0.35).** Three things measured, one of
them a bug:

- Elite's HMD Quality 1.25 submits 6780x6695 per eye against the runtime's
  recommended 5424x5356: exactly 1.25x on each axis (the belief in the
  mechanism paragraph above, now measured). The game rebuilds its targets
  the moment the setting is applied, mid-session, at 1.25x the size it is
  currently being told.
- The resolve armed on the wrong supersampling. The cull guard's stage 1
  asks the game for 7 % wider targets and does not crop them yet, so for
  two seconds every eye arrived at 5792x5356; the resolve saw "1.07x",
  engaged, and the next frame the guard's crop delivered exactly the
  recommended size — which the pass refused as a 1:1 resolve, and the
  door read the refusal as a stand-down for the session. Fixed the same
  day: reports made while the guard is staging are withheld from the
  arming decision, and a region that no longer exceeds the target by more
  than rounding forwards untouched (the boundary disarms) instead of
  standing anything down. A resolve armed before the guard stages keeps
  treating through stage 1, where the game renders true projections into
  the wider targets, so the whole region is the true view at a higher
  density and shrinking it is right.
- Changing HMD Quality mid-session takes the cull guard down: its crop
  snaps to the size the session adopted, the rebuilt textures are 25 %
  off it, and the guard refuses and stands down as designed — silently,
  until the same day's fix gave that refusal its log line. Set HMD Quality
  before launching and the guard stages against the supersampled size
  from the start (stage 1 at 1.25x1.07, the crop at 6780x6695, the resolve
  from there to 5424x5356).

The pass itself compiled and warmed one second into the session and
linked to the door; it never treated a frame on this flight, so the
format and price lines were still unread.

**Second flight (2026-09-02 20:21, same rig, same settings, HMD Quality
set before launch).** The resolve engaged two seconds into the session,
at the menu, once the game had rebuilt its targets to 6780x6695 against
the recommended 5424x5356 (1.25x horizontal, 1.25x vertical), and stayed
engaged: 868 eye-submits resolved in the first forty seconds. Measured:

- **Phase 0 item 2, the format:** the game submits `R8G8B8A8_TYPELESS`
  (DXGI_FORMAT 27), read and written through `R8G8B8A8_UNORM` views, in
  linear light — the same format the render-scale work measured on the
  Quest 3, so both field rigs agree.
- **Phase 0 item 6, the price:** 0.48 ms per eye on average (max 0.80)
  resolving 6780x6695 to 5424x5356 with the calm kernel at radius 1.0 —
  the two dispatches over a 45-megapixel eye. "Well under a millisecond"
  was the belief; half of one is the number.
- **The cull guard, at HMD Quality above 1.0, had a bug of its own.** Its
  stage 1 adopted after 77 ms, against the not-yet-rebuilt 6780-wide
  targets: the pre-stage sizes it requires a change from were zero at a
  session's first staging (the probe only runs during stage 1), zero had
  "moved" to 6780, and 6780 cleared the 0.97 x 5792 threshold that the
  native 5424 never had. The guard froze a canonical of 6349 the game was
  about to abandon, cropped to it for four seconds (a true-FOV image at a
  slightly lower density, geometrically right), and stood down when the
  real 7240-wide targets arrived — now with its own log line. Fixed the
  same day: the pre-stage sizes are seeded by the first submissions after
  stage 1 begins, which are the sizes the game was submitting before it
  rebuilt (it takes about two seconds to do so, measured). The resolve
  followed every one of those sizes faithfully — 6349, 7240, 6780,
  re-adopted at each boundary without a stand-down — which is the
  composition working; the guard just gave it the wrong sizes.

**Third and fourth flights (2026-09-03).** The third, fifteen seconds at
the menu with the servers down, repeated the second's numbers. The fourth
was the Quest 3 over Virtual Desktop at HMD Quality 1.5, four and a half
minutes in a cockpit with the cull guard on: engaged at 3096x3312 against
a recommended 2064x2208 (one texture per eye on that route), 0.09 ms per
eye on average (max 0.48), every frame at a steady 90 fps; the guard's
stage 1 adopted after 1.8 seconds against the rebuilt 3358-wide targets
and its crop landed at 3095x3312 — the seeding fix verified, and the
composed steady state the design describes; eleven transition-flash
withholds went through crop-then-resolve on the shadow path without a
line. One cosmetic finding: the crop's canonical rounds a pixel under the
pre-guard size and the armer re-adopted on it, so the armer now treats two
pixels as rounding, as `supersampleExceeds` does. With the engage line,
the ratio and the price confirmed on both rigs, `auto` became the shipped
default the same day. Still unflown: the double-wide texture with per-eye
bounds (the Steam Link route, desk-verified in the GPU harness) and the
theater path.

## Feature B — temporal anti-aliasing at the door

**What it is.** Each frame, the eye image is blended with a history of the
frames before it, each reprojected to where its content sits now. Content
that flickers on and off the sample grid is averaged across frames into a
stable value; edges converge toward their true coverage. This is the
technique every modern engine uses against exactly this complaint, and the
one Elite lacks. It is also the technique with a reputation — softness,
ghosting — and the design's job is to earn the first without paying the
second.

**Where it runs.** At submit, on the game's finished LDR eye image, before
any other treatment (crop, resolve, theater, heal): the first line of the
door lambda, so every path is treated once. Running inside the game's post
chain — between tonemap and HUD, where an engine would put it — would mean
hooking passes by hash and is not needed: filtering after the HUD is a
feature here, because the HUD's hairlines are among the worst offenders.

**The pass, per eye.** For each output pixel: read this frame's depth,
reconstruct the view-space position through this frame's projection,
transform by the camera's motion since last frame, project through last
frame's projection, and sample the history there (Catmull-Rom, so the
history does not blur under repeated resampling). Clamp the sampled
history to the current frame's 3×3 neighbourhood in YCoCg (variance
clipping — the standard bound on ghosting: history that disagrees with
everything around the pixel is pulled to the nearest agreeing value).
Blend with a weight, write the result as both the output and the new
history. A reprojection that lands off the image, or across a depth
discontinuity, takes the current pixel unblended.

**The camera motion, in two grades:**

1. *v1 — head motion only.* The head pose at `WaitGetPoses` composed with
   the eye-to-head transform, this frame against last. Exact for the
   cockpit, which moves only with the head relative to the camera; wrong
   for the world outside the canopy by whatever the *ship* did in one
   frame. Distant content barely moves under ship translation, but ship
   rotation shifts the whole view — a roll at 60°/s is about ten pixels a
   frame at 90 Hz at the field Quest 3's measured eye size — and the clamp
   then rejects most of the history. The pass degrades to no anti-aliasing
   during fast turns, which is when aliasing is hardest to see, and works
   fully when the ship is steady, which is when the shimmer is worst.
   Acceptable for a first flight; not the end state.
2. *v2 — the game's camera.* The flash detector already reads the game's
   camera buffer every frame; if it carries the view matrix (Phase 0
   reads it), the reprojection is exact for every static thing in the
   world — planets, stations, terrain, the cockpit alike — and only
   independently moving objects (other ships, NPCs, particles) are left
   to the clamp. That is the state every injected TAA lives in, and the
   clamp is what makes it presentable.

**The jitter, which is what makes this anti-aliasing rather than
smoothing.** Without it, the history holds only the sample positions the
head's own motion happened to visit: real integration while the head
moves, nothing new while it is held still — flicker freezes rather than
resolves, which is tolerable but not the goal. With it, each frame's
projection is shifted by a sub-pixel offset from a low-discrepancy
sequence (Halton 2,3, the conventional choice), so consecutive frames
sample different positions inside every pixel by construction, and the
history converges to a genuine supersample of the scene even at rest. The
mechanism is the cull guard's, with a different number: the raw tangents
shifted by `jx·(r−l)/width` horizontally (one pixel is `(r−l)/width` in
tangent units) and the vertical equivalent, the matrix elements following,
the offset advanced at the frame boundary and held for the whole frame —
the consistency rule `system_hook.cpp` already enforces, unchanged. The
compositor never sees the jitter as a wobble: the pass blends each frame
*as rendered* with a history that sits on the unjittered grid, so what is
submitted is nine parts settled history to one part of a sample under
half a pixel off, the convention since Karis 2014. (v1 resampled the
current frame onto the grid instead, and the first flight found text a
little fuzzy: a bilinear resample at a half-pixel offset is a half-pixel
tent every frame, and the history converged to that blur. Measured
2026-09-03, Quest 3, HMD Quality 1.5.)

**Interactions, each decided here:**

- **The game's own AA must be off.** SMAA and FXAA soften sub-pixel detail
  the temporal filter would otherwise resolve, and stacking two softeners
  is the blur everyone dislikes about TAA. EDVR cannot read the game's
  setting, but it can recognise the setting's *passes*: SMAA is three
  distinctive full-screen draws (edge detection, blend weights,
  neighbourhood blend), FXAA one. Phase 0 collects their hashes; the pass
  then says once in the log "Elite's anti-aliasing appears to be on —
  turn it off for this feature", which is the whole of the player's
  "turn off AA in game" step, verified rather than trusted.
- **The transition-flash withhold.** A withheld frame breaks continuity;
  the history resets on the withhold and rebuilds over the next few
  frames. One frame of extra aliasing where the player was about to see a
  lurch is not a regression.
- **The cull guard.** Jitter is applied to the lied frustum, in the
  lied image's pixel units; the pass runs on the full wide image before
  the crop, so the history has margin at the edges and reprojection near
  the border lands on content instead of off the image. An unlooked-for
  benefit of rendering the margin.
- **`render_scale` below 1.0.** TAA at the render size, then EASU up: the
  filter sees the pixels that were rendered and the upscaler sees a calm
  input. (A fused temporal upscale — what FSR 2 and DLSS are — is
  declined below.)
- **The on-foot flat screen.** First person on foot is a texture on a
  panel; the eye projection's jitter moves the panel by a sub-pixel, not
  the content rendered into it, so on foot the pass smooths without
  integrating. The on-foot picture's own sharpness is `vscreen_res`, the
  existing fix, and the pass does not change that.
- **Elements that do not go through the projection.** A full-screen quad
  drawn in clip space does not jitter with the scene: its sample is the
  same every frame while the history around it integrates a jittered
  scene, so it neither wobbles nor supersamples — it is smoothed only by
  the head's motion. The census names which draws are which, and Phase
  0's jitter A/B is where it is looked for. The sun-glare draws EDVR
  already re-authors are the likeliest members of this class.
- **Two eyes.** Separate histories, filtered identically; each eye's
  output is a deterministic function of its own inputs, so the only
  binocular differences the pass can produce are the ones already in the
  content. The project's rule that two eyes must never disagree is
  respected by construction, and the SubmitPairLatch logic is untouched.
- **The runtime's reprojection.** Motion smoothing and ASW act on the
  submitted frames; they neither see nor care that those frames were
  temporally filtered.

**Cost.** Per eye: one compute dispatch reading the frame, the depth and
the history (a handful of taps per pixel) and writing two textures; two
history textures and one depth copy per eye resident. Believed a fraction
of a millisecond per eye at Quest-3 sizes; measured by timestamp query in
Phase 0 and printed in the log and, once it exists, the monitor. The
jitter costs nothing. The depth copy is the one price that depends on the
game: if the depth target is readable as a shader resource it is free, if
not it is one `CopyResource` per eye.

**Fail-safes.** Both features need both files, like the theater: the door
is in `openvr_api.dll`, the passes are exports of `d3d11.dll` (the
cross-DLL pattern), and the jitter is the system hook's. An install with
one file stands down and says so in the theater's "mismatched pair?"
voice. Any refused format, any failed compile, any depth target the
classifier cannot name: the pass stands down for the session, says why
once, and every frame forwards as today. A jitter with the pass down is a
frame drawn a sub-pixel off — invisible, but pointless — so the jitter
arms only after the pass has treated a frame, and disarms with it.

**Settings** (`[fix]`, as built):

```
temporal_aa        = off   ; off | on | dlaa | dlss. Live, like the rest:
                           ; the projection edit is in from every launch.
temporal_aa_jitter = on    ; the sub-pixel projection jitter. Off =
                           ; smoothing only.
temporal_aa_blend  = 0.90  ; history weight, 0.50..0.95: higher is calmer
                           ; and slower to change. Live.
temporal_aa_clamp  = 1.0   ; how far history may stray from the current
                           ; neighbourhood, in standard deviations: lower
                           ; means less ghosting and more flicker. Live.
render_sharpness   = 0.0   ; AMD's RCAS on every outgoing frame, the last

                           ; Start at 0.3 to 0.5. Live.
```

and under `[advanced]`, for the field's A/B: `temporal_aa_motion = head |
camera | none` and `temporal_aa_view_transpose`.

**What was built (2026-09-03: v1, off by default; flown once, below).** The
openvr half (`src/openvr/temporal_aa.cpp`) owns the jitter and the head:
each frame boundary advances a Halton (2,3) offset over eight frames and
tells the system hook the shift of every tangent it implies (`src/common/
temporal_math.h`, `temporalJitterToTangents`); the system hook applies it
in both the raw thunk and the matrix receiver, or in neither — the
receiver installs at launch when `temporal_aa` is on, exactly as it does
for the guard, and a session where it did not (the key turned on live, or
the runtime's matrix failing the tangent-formula check) runs the pass as a
smoother and says so once. The head pose at `WaitGetPoses`, before any
EDVR offset, is kept as a pair, and its rotation delta (`temporalHeadDelta`)
is handed to the pass per eye. The treatment runs first at the door, on
the game's own frame at render size, on the forward path only; the
theater's and heal's renderings and a withheld frame's shadow each mark
the history broken, and the next real frame starts it afresh. The d3d11
half (`edvrTemporalAa`, `src/d3d11/temporal_pass.cpp`) does the pass: per
pixel, this frame's pixel as rendered, the pixel's direction
through this frame's frustum rotated by the delta and projected through
last frame's (`temporalReproject`, transcribed), the history fetched there
with a nine-tap Catmull-Rom, clipped to the current 3x3 neighbourhood's
mean ± γσ in YCoCg, blended at the configured weight, and written as the
output (the game's own format) and the new history (R10G10B10A2, float16
where that cannot be stored to; two per eye). Rotation only, no depth: v1
as designed, with the game's camera as an experiment behind
`temporal_aa_motion = camera` — the view rows the sun-glare fix measured
at float 932 of the scene block, latched at each frame's first eye draw,
with `temporal_aa_view_transpose` for the reading the field has to settle.
The pass counts, per frame, the pixels whose history was rejected (off the
image or none yet) and clipped, and the graphics log's totals line prints
both as percentages beside the price: with the head turning and the ship
steady, a correct reprojection keeps both low, which is the instrument
Phase 0 item 5 and the camera question both read. Desk-verified:
`tools/temporal_test` pins the sequence, the shift's sign, the mapping on
the Quest 3's frustum, both deltas and the reprojection against a known
turn; `tools/smoke` runs the pass on a real device.

**Flown (2026-09-03, Quest 3 over Virtual Desktop at HMD Quality 1.5,
Elite's SMAA off, motion from the head, blend 0.90, clamp 1.0).** The
pass engaged on the first forwarded frame and ran the session at 0.20 ms
per eye at 3096x3312 (max 0.65), with the resolve after it at 0.09; the
history was rejected for 0.5–0.7% of pixels and clipped for 17–19%, the
head turning in a cockpit — the reprojection by the head is right, which
was the question. The jitter went live a few frames after the pass
configured, once the game's first `GetProjectionMatrix` per eye had
passed the tangent-formula check; the first build asked once, was told
"not yet", and printed that the session could not be jittered, then
jittered anyway (that line now waits for a verdict, and a "jitter is
live" line says when). The one complaint: text "a little fuzzy". Two
causes, both answered the same day. The first build resampled the
current frame bilinearly onto the unjittered grid, a half-pixel tent
every frame that the history converged to; the frame is now blended as
rendered (the design text above). And every temporal filter softens by
resampling its history each frame, which is what the sharpen at the door
is for: `render_sharpness`, the seam feature A had marked, built now.

**Flown again the same day (the second build, sharpen at 0.4 then 0.8
live).** Jitter live from the first frame, 0.21 ms per eye, the sharpen
0.04 ms. The world was right and the cockpit was not: text ghosted and
jittered when the head moved, and stayed a little soft under a sharpen
strong enough to ring, while the clip share rose to 24% of pixels. That
is what a history which does not land on NEAR content looks like, and
rotation-only cannot land it: the head's translation, which v1 ignores,
moves a panel at 0.6 m by about two pixels a frame during a 30°/s turn at
Quest 3 densities (24 px/deg at the centre of a 3096-wide eye), and by a
fraction of a pixel from tracking noise alone while the world at infinity
does not move at all. A misregistered history is a soft one, which no
sharpen recovers; and where the clip rejects it, the raw jittered frame
shows through with its half-pixel wobble. Two other explanations were
worth a measurement before building on depth: a pipelined renderer that
lands each frame a pose late, and the game's own camera rows being the
better source. So the third build carries the instruments, not a fix:
every treated frame also judges four candidate deltas by the same clip
(the head's as used, the head's one frame earlier, the camera rows as
world→view, the same rows transposed) and prints their clip shares, each
with the mean size of its clips in luma so a nudge on a text edge and a
misplaced history read apart, beside the used delta's split by head speed
(still, slow, fast) as a `temporal aa registration` line; and a depth probe (Phase 0 item 3,
`src/d3d11/depth_probe.cpp`) reports which texture the eye draws bind as
their depth target, its format and bind flags, whether a shader view can
be made over it or it must be copied, which eye's it is by the order they
are bound, and a 16x16 grid of its values read at the moment the game
clears it, with the clear value that says standard or reversed. **v2's
shape, from this:** per-pixel depth turns the head's full pose delta
(rotation and translation, per eye) into an exact reprojection of the
cockpit, and the game's camera delta into the world's; the two are told
apart by depth (the cockpit is within a few metres), which is also the
first thing the probe measures.

**The third flight (2026-09-03, the main menu, which is where all three
flights were: a ship model turning on its own and a menu floating in
space, the head the only camera motion).** The registration line settled
two questions. The head's delta as used beat the same delta one frame
earlier on both count and size (21% of pixels clipped by 1.2/255 against
30% by 1.8), so the frame renders with the pose `WaitGetPoses` returned
for it: no lag. The game's camera rows were far worse in that scene (53%
by 5.0 read as world→view, 62% by 6.5 transposed), so they are not the
head's motion there, and the untransposed reading is the right one; the
transposed slot went to a fourth candidate, the delta of the game-pose
array's HMD pose, for a renderer that draws with those. The clip share
rose with head speed (11%, 20%, 28% still to fast) while the size barely
did (0.5, 1.2, 1.5/255): most clips are edge nudges, and the text's
misregistration is a small fraction of them, so the ghost the player sees
on the panel is diluted in the mean. The depth probe found the targets:
`R32G8X24_TYPELESS` textures viewed as `D32_FLOAT_S8X24_UINT`, bind flags
`0x48` (shader-readable directly), two at 2064x2208 before the HMD
Quality rebuild and four per frame at 3096x3312 after it (bound first at
eye draws 2, 4, 12 and 15), cleared to 0.0, so reversed-Z. Every sampled
value read 0.000: the probe read the texture while the game still had it
bound as the depth target, and D3D hands a shader a null view for that,
so the fourth build samples at the moment the game unbinds a target, with
the output-merger stage cleared first.

**The fourth flight (2026-09-03, the main menu again).** The head's delta
as used beat the lagged one a second time (18% by 1.3/255 against 24% by
1.6), and the game-pose candidate never got a delta: the game asks
`WaitGetPoses` for no game poses at all, so the render pose is the only
pose it has, which settles the association for good. The depth probe read
0.000 from every target again, at the first unbind with the stage
cleared, for targets the game clears through `ClearDepthStencilView` (to
0.0) and for ones it never does. Two readings remain: the shader view
over a depth texture is being nulled by a hazard the probe does not see,
or the targets hold nothing at the unbinds it sampled. The fifth build
decides both at once: every sample is read through the direct view AND
through a copy (a copy is not subject to a view's binding hazards), at
the LAST switch away from the target in a frame (last frame's count says
which), and `tools/smoke` now runs the probe's own sampler over a depth
texture of the game's family cleared to 0.5, both ways, so the mechanism
is proven at the desk before the flight. The player's two observations
from this flight are placed elsewhere: text shimmers more under yaw than
pitch because Latin text is mostly vertical stems, which a horizontal
shift aliases and a vertical one barely touches, with a small extra
parallax term for yaw from the eye's lever arm about the head; and the
softness is the resolve's calm kernel, chosen for a session WITHOUT a
temporal filter -- with one, the resolve can be crisp because the
temporal box has already band-limited the
frame, and `render_sharpness` can go to 1.0.

**The fifth flight (2026-09-03, the main menu, the resolve now crisp).**
"Looks better." The probe read 0.000 through the copy as well as the
view, from every target the eye draws bind, at the last switch away from
each: those buffers are empty at that moment, so the scene's depth is
written by draws the eye classifier never counts -- a depth pre-pass with
no colour target is the usual shape -- and the sixth build censuses every
draw's depth target (draws per frame, how many with an eye-sized colour
target, how many with none) and samples them all. Two observations
placed: shimmer under yaw remains (near content under translation, for
depth); and with the head STILL, the ship model's horizontal lines
shimmered constantly, which is the clip: its box was built from the
current frame's 3x3, which hops with the jitter on a thin line, so a
converged history sat inside the box one frame and outside the next and
flickered at the jitter's period, and where it was rejected outright the
raw jittered sample showed. The sixth build blends a jitter-aware
filtered current sample (a Gaussian of sigma 0.47 px over the 3x3, each
sample weighted by its distance from the pixel's centre on the unjittered
grid, UE4's filter) and weights the clip's moments the same way, so
neither the box nor a rejected pixel moves with the jitter;
`advanced.temporal_aa_current = raw` keeps the point sample for an A/B.
At 3096 wide before a 1.5x resolve the filter's softening is a third of
an output pixel.

**The sixth flight (2026-09-03), and the player's comparison.** Less
shimmer in the text while moving; a faint shimmer everywhere at rest. The
registration line said why: clipped 35% of pixels by 0.3/255 with the
head still, against 11% by 0.5 before -- weighting the clip's moments by
the filter narrowed the box to the filter's width, and the clip fired by
hair-widths on a third of the pixels. The seventh build keeps the
filtered sample and puts the box back to the plain 3x3. The census named
every depth target the immediate context binds: each VR-sized one gets
ONE draw a frame, and the only target with content is a 2626x1477
`D24_UNORM_S8_UINT` at 12 draws a frame, cleared to 1.0 -- the flat
monitor view. No `ExecuteCommandList` was ever seen and no foreign draws
were counted, so the menu's eye draws bind no depth at all, or the scene
is drawn by the indirect entry points the classifier never runs; the
seventh build counts every draw by kind (with and without a depth target,
indirect or not) and also reads each target at the frame boundary through
a reference it holds, after every draw of the frame. Separately, the
player compared against an install without the temporal pass at HMD
Quality 1.5: **the text is much sharper without it**, and the ship's
shimmering line shimmers there too. Both are placed honestly. The line is
the game's own sub-pixel detail on a turning model, which no pass at the
door settles without motion vectors. The softness has three parts: a
temporal supersample converges to a box-filtered image, softer than
point-sampled text with hard aliased edges by construction; every frame
the history is resampled a fraction of a pixel off, since a tracked head
is never still (the "still" bucket admits 0.03° a frame, 0.7 px at this
density) and those losses compound through the exponential average; and
the near-content misregistration of a rotation-only reprojection, for
depth. The seventh build gives the pass two levers against the second
part: `advanced.temporal_aa_history_sharp` (the resampling cubic's C, 0.5
Catmull-Rom to 1.0, live) and `advanced.temporal_aa_snap` (a rest snap:
under 0.15 px of motion the history is fetched at its own texel rather
than resampled, live). The first part is the trade the feature IS: a
player who values crisp text over calm edges is better served by the
resolve alone, and the README says so.

**The seventh flight (2026-09-03) settled the main menu.** The full
census: 24 draws a frame reach the context EDVR hooks, 14 with an
eye-sized colour target, 4 with a depth target (one each), none indirect,
no command lists ever. A hangar with a ship model is not 24 draws, and the
player confirmed the model never moves: the menu's ship and panel are a
pre-rendered stereo image put in front of each eye, and the census cannot
find scene depth there because there is none. The shimmer that survives
with the head held still -- white and grey text more than orange -- is
the same near-content story at its smallest scale: tracking noise moves
the head a fraction of a millimetre a frame, which at a couple of metres
is a tenth or two of a pixel that a rotation-only reprojection cannot
follow, so a high-contrast stroke's history lands a hair off and the clip
rejects it or the blend flickers; luminance flicker is what the eye sees,
and orange has half the luminance contrast of white. The next census runs
in the cockpit, where the scene is live geometry with thousands of draws
and a depth target the probe will name.

**Motion vectors, and DLSS.** The pass has no motion vectors. It has a
rotation-only camera reprojection, which is a motion field exact for
content at infinity and wrong by the head's translation for everything
near; the game exposes none (its SMAA is spatial, and no motion-vector
pass exists to read), and object motion is unrecoverable from outside.
Per-pixel depth turns the camera's full pose delta into camera motion
vectors, which is what DLSS, DLAA and FSR 2 consume together with colour,
the jitter offset and the projection -- exactly the plumbing this branch
built (the jitter through the projection edit, the pose delta, the door
pass), plus the one input still missing. With depth found, DLAA (DLSS at
native size, no upscale) is the tool for shimmer at this quality: a
trained history handler with the exact registration my clip lacks, and
text is where it shows. Objects that move on their own would still carry
no motion of their own, which DLSS tolerates better than a hand-rolled
clip. It needs an NVIDIA RTX GPU and the NGX runtime beside the game; FSR
2 needs neither and takes the same inputs. Step one is the cockpit census.

**The cockpit census (2026-09-03, docked at a station) found the scene's
depth.** Two targets, one per eye, 3358x3312 (the guard-widened render
size), `R32G8X24_TYPELESS` under a `D32_FLOAT_S8X24_UINT` view, bind
flags `0x48` (a shader view can be made over them directly), 302 and 325
draws a frame, cleared to 0.0. Their values read as reversed-Z with the
game's own near plane of 0.025 m and make physical sense for a docked
cockpit: nearest sample 1.25 m, centre 13.6 m, farthest 46 m, no far-plane
samples because the hangar encloses the view. Two more targets of that
size get 6 and 7 draws with a handful of samples at 1.2 m -- a separate
cockpit layer. The rest are shadow maps (512x512 and 256x256 `D16`, 191
and 26 draws, no colour target) and the flat interface surfaces (`D24S8`,
cleared to 1.0). The registration line moved the way the theory predicts:
clips in the cockpit average 4/255 against 1/255 in the menu, since the
cockpit has real near content. Phase 0 item 3: measured.

**v2, step one (built the same day, `temporal_aa_motion = depth`).** Per
pixel, the scene's depth turns the pixel into a point: P = z·d with z =
near·far / (depth·(far − near) + near) (`temporalDepthToMetres`), moved
into last frame's eye space by delta·P + tv where tv = delta·e +
R_prev^T(t_now − t_prev) − e (`temporalHeadTranslation`; e the eye's
offset from `GetEyeToHeadTransform`, asked once through the original
entry), then projected through last frame's frustum as before. Where
there is no depth (the far plane, or none bound) the direction alone is
rotated, which is v1's path. The depth probe hands the pass the scene
target for each eye by size and draw count, ordered by first bind in the
frame with the first taken as the left eye; the registration instrument's
candidates are now the head's rotation alone, the head with depth and the
eyes SWAPPED, the camera rows, and the head with depth as assigned, so one
flight says whether the assignment is right (the swapped candidate loses)
and how much the translation buys (the depth candidates beat the rotation
alone at rest and under slow turns). The output-merger stage is cleared
around the pass's dispatch, since the game's depth target may still be
bound there at submit and a view over a bound target reads as nothing.

**The first depth flight (2026-09-03) verified the plumbing and nothing
else, through three faults of its own.** The eye offsets came through
(±31.6 mm). The pass read the depth with planes 0.1..1000 m: the game
asks for its projection with two pairs of planes, 0.025..50000 for the
scene and 0.1..1000 for something else, and the capture kept the last
pair seen, which reads the cockpit four times too far and under-corrects
the translation by as much; the scene's pair is the one with the
smallest near, and each pair is now logged once. The depth was found at
3096 wide two seconds before the cull guard rebuilt every target at 3358,
and the probe's table, full of the old targets, had no room for the new
ones, so both depth candidates froze for the rest of the session; targets
the game stops binding are evicted after 120 frames. And the candidates
accumulated since each first had data, so the line compared a session of
the rotation-only delta with fifteen seconds of the depth candidates; the
registration line now judges every candidate over the same interval and
starts afresh after each print. The pass also says when the depth goes
away and when it is back.

**The second depth flight (2026-09-03) gave the verdict.** With the head
turning, "head with depth" clipped 12.8% and 10.8% of pixels by 1.8 and
1.6/255 in two clean intervals, against the rotation alone at 21.0% and
17.2% by 3.8, and the swapped-eyes candidate lost to it both times (16.2%
and 12.6%): the depth reprojection registers better, and the eyes are
assigned right. With the head still all candidates are equal, as they
must be. The depth went away for a minute in the middle: the scene's
targets fell to two draws and the world stopped being drawn (the
station's own screens), while the cockpit alone went to a pair with four
to nine draws -- exactly the depth the text needs -- which the selection
rule's fifty-draw threshold refused. The rule is now the busiest pair of
the size, whatever the count, with hysteresis, and the census prints
every twenty seconds. The player's observation this time: with the head
held still, the HUD's text moved "as if read through a heat shimmer, or
underwater". That is the depth path's doing, twice over. Tracking noise
moves the head a fraction of a millimetre a frame, and with depth near
and far pixels are now moved by different sub-pixel amounts; the rest
snap decided per pixel whether to resample or not, so neighbours on
either side of its threshold warped differently from frame to frame, and
at a text stroke's edge the pixel's own depth is either the stroke's or
the background's. The eleventh build scales the fetch offset down
smoothly below the threshold instead of snapping it, and reprojects each
pixel by the NEAREST depth of its 3x3 so an edge follows the thing in
front, which is the standard dilation. The probe's sample line now
carries a 4x4 map of the nearest depth per block in metres, so where the
HUD sits in depth is read straight off it.

**The third depth flight (2026-09-03) confirmed it and made it the
default.** The depth stayed in hand through the guard's rebuild and the
station's screens (the busiest-pair rule following the scene's draws
from two, to nine, to seven hundred a frame), and in every interval with
the head moving the order was the same: "head with depth" best (12.1%,
12.3%, 12.6%, 9.2% of pixels clipped by 1.5 to 2.3/255), the swapped
eyes second, the rotation alone worst (15.6%, 21.5%, 20.6%, 12.9% by 3.0
to 4.0). The map put the cockpit where a cockpit is -- the dashboard at
0.3 to 0.7 m, the panels at 1 to 2 m, the hangar beyond the canopy at 9
to 27 m -- so the HUD's text has the depth the reprojection needs.
`temporal_aa_motion = depth` is the default from here; the pass costs
0.47 ms per eye with the instrument's four candidates still running.

**DLAA (built 2026-09-03, after the player's ask; the rig's GPU is an RTX
5090).** `experimental.temporal_aa = dlaa` hands NVIDIA's DLAA the inputs this
branch already makes: the frame (copied out typed), the scene's depth
(copied as the game wrote it, reversed-Z declared), per-pixel motion
vectors written by the same reprojection the history fetch uses (the
pixel's position last frame minus its position now, in render pixels),
and the jitter offset. NVIDIA's history replaces the pass's own; the
guard's crop, the resolve and the sharpen follow as before. The glue is
`src/d3d11/dlaa.cpp` behind `EDVR_HAVE_NGX`, which `build.bat` sets when
the SDK is under `third_party/ngx` (`tools/fetch_ngx.py`, a sparse clone
of NVIDIA's public repository) or wherever `EDVR_NGX_SDK` points; without
it the mode says so once and the own history runs. The runtime
`nvngx_dlss.dll` must sit beside the game's executable, where NGX looks;
its licence permits shipping it with an application, which is the
installer's job. Objects that move on their own still carry no motion of
their own, which DLSS tolerates better than a hand-rolled clip.

**Flown the same day on both headsets.** On the Pimax Crystal Super (HMD
Quality 1.0, 5424x5356 per eye, 5792 wide under the guard) DLAA engaged
at 2.7 ms per eye and the player's verdict was "amazing, I do not notice
the shimmering text anymore". On the Quest 3 over Virtual Desktop (HMD
Quality 1.5, 3358 wide under the guard, the resolve after) it engaged at
1.0 ms per eye with some shimmer left, which the streaming codec's own
frame-to-frame quantisation of text edges explains as well as anything
the pass does; the check is HMD Quality 1.0 on the Quest, so DLAA's
output goes to the encoder unresolved, and the encoder's bitrate.

**DLSS proper (`temporal_aa = dlss`).** The player asked for it on the
Pimax, where the game's own render at 5424x5356 per eye is the cost that
matters. No size lie is needed: Elite's HMD Quality below 1.0 makes the
game render a fraction of the unit-quality size (the runtime's
recommendation, or the guard's widened answer while its lie stands --
`systemHookUnitQualitySize`), and the pass asks NVIDIA's upscaler to
bring the frame back to that size, the quality mode chosen by the ratio
and stepped down until the input sits within the mode's range. The
motion vectors and the depth are at the render size, as DLSS wants them;
the guard's crop, the resolve (idle, since the crop lands at the
recommendation) and the sharpen follow at the full size. At HMD Quality
1.0 or above the mode behaves as DLAA. The interface surfaces scale with
the render size, so the HUD is drawn smaller and reconstructed; whether
that reads well is the flight's question.

**The rest lock supplies the registered history at rest (merged
2026-09-04, unflown as a pair).** Main's `shimmer_rest` (the section
"The tracker never rests" below) holds the pose the game renders from
while the head is still. The pass notes its motion pose AFTER that hold
and the theater's freeze, before the head offset, so the head delta it
reprojects by is zero at rest, not small: no history resampling while
still, and the jitter becomes a true supersampler of a static scene. The
clean instrument for "the merge is right" is the registration line's
still bucket (under 0.03 deg/frame), whose clip share should fall to the
no-motion floor with the lock on; `temporal_aa_snap` is expected to be
moot and is left in until measured. DLAA and DLSS inherit the held pose
through the same note (docs/rest-lock-handoff.md).

**The review of 2026-09-04, and what it changed (docs/review-motion-vectors-2026-09-04.md,
the Opus 5 review).** An adversarial read of the motion path found that the
trained path had never accumulated a frame: its reset flag was keyed on the
pass's OWN history flag, which the trained path never sets, so NVIDIA was
told "the scene changed completely" on every evaluation of every flight so
far -- DLAA ran as a single-frame spatial filter (hence "no ghosting"), and
DLSS proper had to invent the missing resolution from one frame, which is
what soft text looks like. Fixed: the trained path keeps its own continuity
flag, and the totals line now counts the resets (a handful per session is
right; the evaluation count is the bug). Second, the optimal-settings query
was made on the parameter block from AllocateParameters, which the SDK's
own helper refuses -- the "0x0" render sizes in the flight logs were that
refusal printed as an answer -- so the DLSS mode was chosen blind by the size
ratio; it is now asked on the capability block and the mode is the one
whose own render size is nearest the frame's, within its range. Also: the
previous frame's frustum reaches the motion vectors on the trained path
(keyed on the same flag), NVIDIA gets the frame delta it asks for, the
first trained frame prints what NVIDIA is handed, and a new instrument
counts the game's projection reads on each side of the frame boundary,
since the jitter set there is only the jitter the game rendered with if the
game reads AFTER it -- the guard's constant lie could never test that, and
a one-frame phase error would be up to 0.8 px of stable blur (the review's
F4, unflown). The review's largest cleared item stands as a fact: under
DLSS proper the cockpit's panel text is drawn into interface surfaces that
scale with the INTERNAL render size, so at HMD Quality 0.67 the glyphs are
rasterised at two-thirds size and no upscaler recovers them. DLSS buys
frame time, not text; the flight that separates the two is DLAA at HMD
Quality 1.0 against DLSS at 0.67 with the same output size.

**First flight with a real history (5a0fa2b, Quest 3 at HMD Quality 1.5,
DLAA at 3096x3312, 2026-09-04):** 4 resets in 5597 evaluations, so
NVIDIA accumulated for the first time; the projection reads fell 20 to 8
on the boundary's far side, so the jitter is not a frame late in the
main; the rest lock never held (the Quest's tracking runs 1.2 to 2.8
arcmin a frame against the 0.6 threshold, 28% easing). The player's
verdict: white text noticeably shifts brightness with head movement,
orange less. That is the gap between a converged thin stroke (its energy
spread over the jitter's sub-pixel positions) and a fresh one, opened
whenever the history is discarded or misregistered under motion -- which
a wrong sign in either convention NVIDIA is handed would do on every
moving frame and on no still one. So the desk now measures it: the
conventions rig in tools/smoke draws a band-limited stripe field through
a camera yawing a degree a frame, exactly as the pass's mapping says a
jittered frame looks, runs it through NVIDIA's history with the pass's
own motion vectors, and holds the output against the unjittered truth
for six pairings (motion as computed or negated; jitter as passed, y
flipped, x flipped). The shipped pairing must converge best. For the
game's side, two live instruments under `[advanced]`:
`temporal_aa_jitter_sign` (as_is, flip_x, flip_y, flip_both) and
`temporal_aa_jitter_lag` (0, 1) change only what the consumers are told;
the pairing that makes text sharpest with the head still is the game's
convention, and is then hard-coded.

**The world/ship split (the Pimax flight of 2026-09-04, in space).** With
a real history the review's F6 showed itself at once: the Milky Way
smeared and a rotating station's lights blurred whenever the ship turned,
because the motion vectors described the head alone and the ship's turn
moves everything outside the canopy by a dozen pixels a frame. The
game's own camera rows -- world->view, captured at each frame's first eye
draw for the registration instrument's candidate 2 -- carry the head and
the ship together, so the pass now splits by depth: pixels nearer than
`advanced.temporal_aa_ship_metres` (40; the cockpit and the hull, which
move with the head) keep the head's delta with its translation term,
and pixels farther, plus the far plane, take the camera's delta with the
translation term from the rows' own column, P_prev = R_p R_n^T P + (t_p
- R_p R_n^T t_n). Both the history fetch and the motion-vector entry do
it; the registration line reports the world path's share of pixels, the
share of bright pixels with no depth behind them (HUD text drawn without
a depth write, which no delta can register under head translation), and
the camera's delta against the head's in degrees a frame with the
camera's displacement in metres -- docked, both must read zero, which is
the check that the rows are what the instrument believed (their cockpit
candidate had clipped 3.7% by 7.6/255 with 6.8% off-image where the head
read 8.1% by 2.2, an unexplained shape). The station's own rotation is
object motion and stays unregistered, as in any temporal filter. The
trained path now also acquires the pass's timing and stats slot, so the
totals line prints its real price instead of zero.

**Its first flight (719f3f0, Pimax, 2026-09-04) named two faults, both by
the new figures.** In space the camera's delta differed from the head's
by 36 to 40 degrees a frame and the camera "moved" 681 m a frame: the
latch at the frame's first eye-sized draw was catching another camera's
rows on some frames, NVIDIA purged its history on each, and the station
pulsed bright and dark every couple of seconds. At the main menu the
world path took 74 to 98% of pixels: the backdrop is a pre-rendered
image at the far plane, its camera does not follow the head, and the
hangar's back wall detached and flickered. So the latch now fires at the
first draw into the scene pair's depth target (the scene camera's by
construction; depth_probe.cpp), the delta is dropped for any frame it
differs from the head's by over 3 degrees and its translation for any
jump over 50 m (the floating origin), both counted on the registration
line, and the world path needs a real scene of fifty draws into the pair
a frame. The same line settled the depthless-text question: only 1 to 4%
of bright pixels lack depth in the cockpit and in space, so the HUD text
that moves with the head is not that case.

**Its second flight (75dbda8) named the two faults underneath.** In space
the delta was still dropped on half the frames: the rows come from any
buffer of the scene block's size the game maps, and a reflection or
environment pass maps its own with its own camera between the main
write and the first scene draw on every other frame. The rows are now
kept per buffer object and the latch takes the object BOUND at the
scene's first draw (two constant-buffer queries a frame; the newest
write only as a fallback, counted). And the station stayed sharp with
the head at rest but ghosted with the skybox the moment the head moved:
the rows are the SHIP's camera without the headset in them -- docked,
their delta read exactly a slow head's turn rate against the head's --
so the world path registered the ship's turn and not the head's. The
openvr half now notes the two headset poses and the eye's offset before
each treat (edvrTemporalAaNoteHead), and the world path composes them:
W = R_hp^T C R_hn with the matching translation term (temporal_pass.cpp
derives it), which is the head-only reprojection when the ship is still
and the ship-only one when the head is. Docked, W must equal the head's
delta whichever way the head turns, which is now what the registration
line's figure measures. The menu's hangar wall, which the player says
is real 3D, still detaches under head motion: its eye-sized depth
targets read empty, so its geometry is drawn without a depth write and
reprojects as the far plane; a menu-only depth assumption is the
remaining lever there.

**Its third flight (d2d66f5) settled the composition and moved the
fault.** Docked, the composed world delta read 0.04 to 0.14 degrees a
frame against the head's whichever way the head turned, so the
composition holds; and the menu's hangar wall no longer detaches. In
space the latch found the block bound on every frame and the delta was
STILL dropped on half of them, 75 degrees off on those: the block is
right, the write is wrong -- the game draws into the scene's depth
before it rewrites the block with the main camera on the frames where
it has just rendered a reflection face. So the rows are now chosen at
the frame's first treat, from ALL the frame's writes, by continuity:
the write whose absolute orientation follows last frame's chosen rows
within 3 degrees (a ship turns under 2 a frame; a reflection face or a
shadow cascade sits tens away), the bound object's preferred; and a
frame that still fails the plausibility check carries last frame's
accepted ship delta instead of falling back to the head alone, which
had been smearing the world on every dropped frame. The registration
line says how the choice went (bound, another block's, a resync, none)
and how often the carry ran.

*2026-09-08, a station approach:* continuity is self-reinforcing, and a
chain that lands on another object's camera -- an auxiliary pass of the
station's, written every frame and continuous with itself -- never comes
back on its own, because the bound block's real rows are never within
three degrees of the wrong chain again ("another's on 1774 frames, the
bound block's on 0" for 58 seconds, the head-follow score holding the
world path down the whole time and the station smearing under the ship's
motion). So while the rows have stopped following the head and the bound
block wrote this frame, the chooser now takes the bound block's latest
write over the chain; the score decides when the path comes back, and
the registration line counts those frames (docs/per-object-motion.md
has the flight).

**The fourth flight (e2d93db) made the choice work -- the bound block's
rows on 1,795 of 1,800 frames in space, no drops, no carries -- and the
smear REVERSED direction.** With half the frames head-only the history
trailed the truth; with every frame carrying the ship's delta under one
reading of the rows it leads, which is what an inverted reading does.
The docked check cannot catch that: with the ship still its delta is the
identity and the composition collapses to the head's under either
reading. So the build after adds the instruments that settle it: the
world path reads the rows either way (`temporal_aa_view_transpose`, live
on the trained path for an A/B by eye), the own pass judges BOTH
readings composed with the head as candidates 2 (in use) and 1 (the
other) on its registration line while the ship turns, and
`temporal_aa_debug = motion` paints each pixel's fetch offset into the
eye image (red right, green down, mid-grey still, the world path in
blue) so a skybox that leads or trails the turn is a colour the eye can
read; `error` paints the history's distance from the frame. The menu's
wall, depthless, gets `temporal_aa_menu_metres` as an assumed depth.

**The motion view answered in one flight (ab284a4).** With the rows read
world->view and composed with the head, the world painted mid-grey under
a head turn -- a zero fetch offset -- and moved only when the ship
turned; with the transposed reading and the same composition it moved
twice the head's turn and the sky smeared along the head's travel. Both
follow if the rows already CARRY the headset's pose, stored view->world:
composing the head into a delta that has it either cancels the head
(one reading) or doubles it (the other), and a still ship's delta is the
identity, so the docked figure never noticed. The earlier 'ship camera
without the head' inference read a docked residual of 0.1 to 0.26
degrees a frame as a slow head's rate; it was twice the rate. So the
world path now takes the rows alone, read view->world: W = R_p^T R_n
and tv = R_p^T (c_n - c_p) with c the eye's place in the world; no
composition, no head note. `temporal_aa_view_transpose` defaults to 1
and the docked figure is a real check at last: W must equal the head's
delta whichever way the head turns.

**The own pass in space (bfa61cf) showed the clip instrument's blind
spot.** Both world readings clipped 37 to 47% of pixels against the
head candidates' 15 to 23% while the ship turned -- not because the
world path is wrong, but because a candidate is judged over every
pixel, and the cockpit (a third of the image, textured) clips under any
world delta while the sky (mostly black) clips under nothing. The
comparison never saw the world. So the line now carries two things the
clip share cannot: the used delta's clip share per class (the world
path's pixels and the ship's separately), and REGISTRATION PROBES -- on
a 64-pixel grid, where the frame has texture, the history's best match
within 4 px of the predicted position by a 5x5 luma SAD, the mean
offset reported per class in pixels. A steady offset that follows the
motion is a lag or a scale; noise averages to zero; the jitter's
sub-pixel offset is in every probe and averages out. That is the number
the ghosting reports were missing: whether the reprojection is off by a
pixel, and which way.

**The probes answered (c8dfb14, Pimax, 2026-09-04): the reprojection is
unbiased.** On the ship class the history's best match sat within 0.05
px of the prediction docked and in space; on the world path within 0.2
px while the ship turned. The world path still clipped 38 to 52% of its
pixels in the turn -- a dense star field crossing a 3x3 box that is
black between stars, the own pass's clip doing its job at the price of
the star's sub-pixel blur, which DLSS's history handles better. And the
player's sharpest observation named the last fault: in the HUD's 'Point
Defence', the letters over the cockpit frame held and the letters over
the canopy glass warped with the head. HUD text has no depth in the
scene's target; the 3x3 nearest-depth dilation lends each letter
whatever sits behind it -- the frame's depth, or the sky's far plane and
with it the rotation-only path, which cannot follow the head's
translation for something a metre away. Menus and loading screens are
depthless throughout, so all their text vibrated the same way. The game
draws its HUD in passes with their own eye-sized depth targets (a few
draws a frame, a few samples at 1.4 to 3.8 m, the rest far), so the pass
now binds up to two such layers beside the scene's depth
(`depthProbeLayerDepths`: eye-sized, outside the scene pair, drawn last
frame, sampled sparse-and-near) and reads the NEAREST of all three at
every texel. The registration line's 'bright pixels with no depth' is
the measure of what is left; `temporal_aa_menu_metres` remains the lever
for the menu, whose targets read empty.

**The layers' first flight (da20dd6) drew a new boundary through the
same text.** The HUD pair joined -- eye-sized, four draws a frame, five
samples within two metres and the rest far -- but only after six
minutes, since the probe reached it last; and where it joined, the
letters over the dashboard began to shimmer while the letters over the
glass held, along a rounded edge that moved with the head: the
dashboard's silhouette. The HUD is drawn on top of the cockpit without a
depth test, so where its layer has a depth that is the visible
surface's even where the dashboard behind is nearer, and 'the nearest
of all' picked the dashboard's half metre for text at a metre and a
half. Now the layer wins wherever it has a value -- dilated on its own,
then the scene's depth fills the rest -- and the probe samples eye-sized
targets first and every two seconds, so the pair joins within seconds
of the cockpit appearing. The line names the pair it took.

**The priority build (b07f322) changed nothing by eye, and the log says
why: no layer joined in the hangar at all.** The scene pair is eye-sized
too, so the fast lane sampled IT every two seconds and the HUD pair never
got the staging slot; the pair joined only in space, four minutes in.
The clear region matching the cockpit's silhouette is then exactly the
no-layer picture: text over the structure borrows the structure's depth
and holds, text over the glass borrows the hangar wall's 9 to 27 m, or
the sky's far plane, and cannot follow the head's translation. So the
fast lane now excludes the scene pair, the census prints every eye-sized
target with its draws and its last sample, the registration line says
how much of the image and of its bright pixels a layer's depth covers,
and `temporal_aa_debug = depth` paints the depth's source per pixel --
a layer's green, the scene's grey by distance, none magenta -- so
whether the HUD's text is in the layer at all is a thing the eye can
check.

**The depth view answered (f846b9b, Pimax, 2026-09-04), and closed the
layer route.** The menu's hangar has depth and its UI has none; the
loading screen has none but the spinning ship. The layer the census had
qualified is a head-locked render of the player's own ship seen from
behind and above -- the HUD's schematic camera -- drawn into an
eye-sized depth target; its silhouette was the boundary seen twice,
the text inside it registered by the model's depth and the text outside
by the sky's or the wall's. And none of the cockpit's UI panels or HUD
text writes depth anywhere: the HUD is drawn on top, depthless, and
borrows what is behind it. So the layers are off by default
(`temporal_aa_depth_layers`), and the one lever left is an assumed HUD
distance, `temporal_aa_hud_metres` (off by default; 1.4 is about right),
for pixels that look like the HUD's text -- bright, with three or more
bright neighbours in the 3x3, so a lone star is not one -- and read far
or beyond eight metres; the depth view paints them yellow. Its price is
stated in the key: a bright lamp, a lit panel or a dense star cluster
far away is taken for text and pays the same misregistration in
reverse. NVIDIA's history hides the HUD's problem by rejecting its
misregistered text under motion, which is the difference the player
sees between the trained modes and the pass's own history.

**The same flight (9e20ea4) measured the world path in space.** Its
probes read a steady -0.1 to -0.27 px in both axes while the ship class
read +0.02, and the direction did not follow the motion: that is the
station's own rotation, which is in no vector and which the world probes
are dominated by (the station is the textured thing out there). The
Milky Way's clouds sat below the probes' texture bar, so the skybox
itself was never measured -- it now has its own probe class, the far
plane, with a softer bar. Two more facts from the flight: the menu's
hangar moved with the head at a 40 m split and not at 100 m, because
the menu's camera is head-independent and its rows stand still while
the head turns, so the world path now stands down while the rows turn
less than a third as much as the head (a score, with a line); and the
rows' tiebreak among continuous writes is now the latest, since the
frame's last view matrix is the one the eyes were drawn with.

**The sky probes' first reading (6677fca, in space) put the far plane a
fifth of a pixel off its prediction** -- (-0.22, -0.01) px over 230,000
probes while the ship class read +0.02 in the same interval -- and the
same flight's A/B settled where that error lives: with the depth split
at 100 km, so that everything WITH a depth took the head's path, the
station stopped blurring under a head turn and the skybox did not. The
far plane takes the rows' delta whenever the world path is on, whatever
the split; so the rows' rotation differs from the head's under a head
turn by a small, steady amount, enough to trail a station's lights and
the Milky Way's clouds over ten frames and too small for the
degrees-per-frame figure to show. Three instruments now name it: the
rows' residual against the head by head-speed bucket, with a regression
that gives the scale (the rows turned 1+k times the head) per axis and
a lead in frames; the probes' least-squares scale per class (a signed
mean cancels over a head that turns both ways, a regression on the
vector does not); and the chooser's ambiguity, the frames on which a
second continuous write differed from the chosen and by how much. The
write ring grew from 48 to 256, since the game writes the block 114
times a frame in space and the eyes' early writes had fallen out of it
before the frame was chosen; and the head's delta is now composed into
each eye's frame through the eye-to-head rotation (a no-op on parallel
panels, logged once as the cant). The no-build A/B for the flight:
`temporal_aa_ship_metres = 0` turns the world path off entirely, so the
sky reprojects by the head's own delta -- a clean sky there convicts
the rows, a smeared one the game's own sky.

**The instrument's first flight (a9f55f8) named the bug outright.** With
the world path off the sky stopped smearing and the station rendered
better, leaving only the station's panels blurring under a SHIP turn,
which the head's delta cannot know. And the regression read, over a
dozen intervals in space, k = -2 about x and y and 0 about z: the rows
turned minus one times the head in pitch and yaw and plus one in roll
(the menu, whose camera stands still, read exactly -1 on all three).
Pitch and yaw reversed with roll kept is a rotation read in a z-forward
view space and applied in a z-backward one -- the game's is DirectX, z
forward; the runtime's eye space runs z back. The far plane, on the
rows' delta alone, had moved the wrong way by the head's whole turn,
and the probes' four-pixel window saturating both ways is what made
that read as a fifth of a pixel. The rows' delta and its translation
term are now conjugated by the z flip into the eye's frame; a
still-ship regression of the rows' translation on the head's (+1 on
every axis if the flip is a reflection, -1 if it is a half turn) checks
the translation's sign, since the rotation cannot tell the two apart.
The same flight showed a second continuous write on nearly every frame,
a head-turn's angle from the chosen: the game's own last-view block,
which the chooser now skips when its rows equal last frame's pick
(kept as the fallback for a camera that truly stood still). The eyes
sit at zero degrees on the Pimax, so the cant composition is a no-op
there.

**The flight after it (Pimax, then a Quest 3 over Steam Link) confirmed
the flip and closed two headset questions.** The rows now turn 1.00
times the head on every axis (k within 0.01 of zero, against -1.92
before), the residual sits at four hundredths of a degree a frame, the
lead is zero, and the still-ship translation regression reads +1 per
axis -- the flip is a reflection and the shipped sign is right. The
Quest 3's frustum is asymmetric VERTICALLY (t -1.4281, b +0.9657)
where the Pimax's is symmetric, which makes it the first headset to
test the vertical mapping; it is correct, because the header and the
shader both send the top row to b and the bottom to t, which is what
OpenVR's own GetProjectionMatrix produces. The eyes read zero cant on
both headsets. What is left is sampling density: the Pimax renders
about 42 pixels per degree and the Quest 3 about 20 at three quarters
quality, so the same frame shimmers more there with every setting
identical, and the engage line now prints the number so a comparison
between two headsets can be held level. The reload line now names the
mode as well -- it said "on" for dlaa and dlss too, and a whole
session's logs read as the pass's own history while NVIDIA's ran.

**Matching the density left a residue, and the residue has a name.** With
the Quest 3 raised to 40.6 pixels per degree against the Pimax's 42.3 the
shimmer improved but did not go, and the rest lock's own totals say why:
the Pimax holds 8% of its frames and floors at 0.53 arcmin of motion a
frame, while the Quest 3 over Steam Link held 0% of 15,569 frames and
never got quieter than 1.90. The hold threshold is 0.60. A rendered pixel
at that density is 1.48 arcmin, so the Quest 3's pose stream slides the
image more than a whole pixel every frame with the head still, which is
the hairline blink `experimental.shimmer_rest` was built to stop -- and the fix
cannot engage, because its threshold sits below the tracker's own noise
floor. It spends the whole session in the easing band instead, where the
compositor is told a pose the frame was not rendered from. The totals
line now prints the floor beside the threshold and says so outright when
the one is above the other. `advanced.shimmer_rest_still` and
`advanced.shimmer_rest_moving` are the keys; whether raising them past a
noisy tracker's floor buys back the hold without a lag on slow turns is
the next flight's question.

**The review of the same evening (docs/review-temporal-far-warp-darkness-2026-09-04.md),
and what it changed.** Asked what warps a station several kilometres off
and what could make the game read darker than stock. The far path itself
held: the station read its true depth (4.9 to 7.2 km in the scene pair's
map), the rows turned with the head within six hundredths in steady space,
and nothing is lost at that range. What warps it is the assumed HUD
distance, which the live ini and the tester handout had at 2.4 m: every
bright pixel with bright neighbours beyond eight metres -- a station's lit
faces, its lights, a two-pixel star -- was reprojected at 2.4 m on the
head's path while the dark faces beside it took the world's, and the
trained path's depth copy said 2.4 m too; a heat-haze on lit structure at
long range, worse on a noisier tracker. The handout and the live ini now
leave it at 0, and the key's comment names the station. Four things were
built: the row chooser prefers the bound object's continuous write again
(latest-of-any-object had taken a stale block on half the frames of every
supercruise and arrival interval, the rows turning a quarter to a half of
the head there); a floating-origin jump is dropped before it can be stored
as the last-good translation and carried into a later dropped frame; the
trained path hands out NVIDIA's frame copied into the game's own format,
so the compositor is told a typeless texture on every path (the one
uniform brightness change the trained path could have made), and refuses
any family but R8G8B8A8 with a line; and the rest snap defaults to 0,
since a per-pixel snap accumulates a lag of about nine times the motion it
suppresses (up to 0.7 px on slowly drifting distant content) and the rest
lock now does its job at rest. Unflown as of the commit; the registration
line's "another's", "carried" and k figures are the verification for the
first two, a docked panel and the main menu for the third.

**The cleanup of the same evening.** Five levers the record had proven
wrong or dead came out, so the pass has fewer ways to be misconfigured:
the rest snap (an accumulating lag, above); the HUD depth layers (the only
layer ever found was the ship model's schematic render); the assumed HUD
distance (it caught a station's lit faces and missed orange text); the
`camera` motion source (the rows alone, read without the z flip -- wrong
since the flip was measured); and the transposed-reading A/B with the
instrument's candidate 1 (the reading is settled: view->world). The
shader reads one depth again, the cbuffer lost a row, and the depth view
paints the scene's depth in grey and no depth in magenta. Two things were
found on the way: `temporal_aa_motion = head` had never been assigned by
the parser since depth became the default, so it silently ran depth (fixed);
and the rotation angle behind the residual, the continuity test and the
head-speed buckets was an acos of the trace in float, which cannot resolve
below about 0.02 degrees -- the "still" residuals of 0.025 degrees a frame
in every steady interval were that floor -- and now takes the skew into
account and is exact at small angles. Unflown with the rest.

**The projection edit is in from every launch (the same evening).** The
receiver in the runtime's GetProjectionMatrix slot used to install only
when the cull guard or the temporal pass was on at launch, so a key turned
on later ran without its half of the edit -- the pass as a smoother with
no jitter, the guard not at all -- and the settings window had to call
both "restart" when the three keys returned to it. Idle, the receiver
forwards the matrix unchanged, so it is now installed whatever the settings
say, both keys are live from off, and `advanced.projection_edit = off`
keeps the observation thunk for a rig where the receiver misbehaves.

## Feature C — texture LOD bias, the small lever

Not all shimmer is geometry. Detail maps and normal maps sampled a mip
level too sharp for the pixel density alias on their own — terrain at
altitude and hull panelling at a distance are the usual places — and the
cure is a fraction of a mip level of bias toward the softer level. D3D11
samplers carry this as `MipLODBias`, set once when the sampler is created.

**Mechanism.** Hook `CreateSamplerState` on the device (slot 23, to be
SDK-verified the way `CreateTexture2D` was) and add the configured bias
to every sampler's own. The game's anisotropic setting is left alone. A
positive bias trades texture sharpness for calm; a negative one is what
upscaling tools apply to *restore* detail at reduced render sizes, and
`render_scale` below 1.0 may want exactly that — one setting, both signs.

Samplers are created early, so v1 takes effect at restart. Live tuning
would mean substituting biased clones at bind time — one more context
slot on the hot path, which this project spends reluctantly — and waits on
the field wanting it.

**Settings sketch** (`[fix]`):

```
texture_lod_bias = 0.0   ; -1.0..+1.0 added to every sampler's mip bias.
                         ; +0.3 calms detail-map shimmer; negative
                         ; sharpens. Restart.
```

## Feature D — specular anti-aliasing in the lighting resolve

The sparkle on hulls and station skins is specular aliasing: a normal map's
sub-pixel structure produces highlights narrower than a pixel, and the
lighting samples them at one point. Engines treat it in the lighting
shader by widening the surface's roughness in proportion to how fast the
shading normal varies across the pixel (geometric specular anti-aliasing;
the screen-space derivative of the normal is the measure), or by a plain
roughness floor. Neither needs the temporal machinery, and each removes
the residual glint that even TAA leaves during motion.

EDVR has swapped the deferred lighting resolve's pixel shader before
(`resolve_probe.cpp`, hash `7CECABDE34FFBE9E`, for one draw, put back
after), so the mechanism exists. The cost is the replacement: the probe
emitted a constant, while this would be the game's whole lighting shader
transcribed from disassembly with one branch added — the largest
transcription this project would have attempted, and it covers only
what that one resolve lights (the scanner and any forward-lit surfaces
are separate passes; Phase 0 names them). Listed here because it is the
one lever that reaches the *cause* of the specular shimmer rather than its
appearance, and deliberately last: it is justified only by residual
sparkle measured after feature B, not before.

## The field's proposal: motion vectors from the game's own matrices

The proposal is correct in every particular, and it is feature B's v2. Where
this design differs from the ReShade-addon framing it arrived in is in how
much of the work is already done, and in one thing an addon cannot do at
all:

- **The camera is already read.** The flash detector reads the game's
  camera buffer every frame, recognised by size and validated by the shape
  of its contents (`src/d3d11/glitch_frame.h`) — no RenderDoc session, no
  shader-layout reverse engineering, and it is the read that has already
  survived every game update this project re-verifies per build
  (`docs/build-332753.md` is the procedure). Feature B's exposure to
  updates is the flash fix's, which the project carries today. Whether
  that buffer holds the full view matrix or only the position is Phase 0
  item 4; if the latter, the search is one census with the constant-buffer
  watch (`advanced.census_cb_watch`) pointed at the scene's vertex shaders.
- **The projection is not reverse-engineered; EDVR hands it to the game.**
  Each eye's projection comes from the system hook's own answers, per
  frame, exactly — including the jitter EDVR added. And the submit hook
  names the eye. Neither is knowable from inside a post-process injection,
  which sees one texture and must guess both.
- **The depth buffer is named, not guessed.** The census classifier ties
  the depth view to the eye draws it serves; a generic depth heuristic
  picking the on-foot screen's depth, or the scanner's, is the kind of
  failure that instrument exists to exclude.
- **The jitter.** No post-process injection can move the game's sample
  positions. EDVR can, through the answers it already edits, and that is
  the difference between temporally *smoothing* the shimmer and
  anti-aliasing it: without new sample positions the history converges to
  the same aliased image the game drew; with them it converges to a
  supersample of the scene.

**Per-object matrices, declined on purpose.** The proposal's caveat is
right about the cost and the fragility, and the design's answer is that
they are not needed. Unmatched motion is what the neighbourhood clamp is
for: history that disagrees with the pixels around it is bounded to them,
so an object the reprojection missed shows a frame or two of its own
aliasing rather than a trail. Elite's moving population is also kind to
this: a station ring turns slowly in pixels per frame, planets slower
still, and other ships are small in the frame at any range where their
edges could shimmer. If v2 leaves visible ghosting on a passing ship, the
next step is a reactive weight — blending less where the clamp is doing
the most work, which the pass can compute for itself — not a per-draw
matrix capture and an object-ID pass, which is the engine's own velocity
buffer built from outside and re-built after every update.

*Revisited on 2026-09-07 in [per-object-motion.md](per-object-motion.md):
the formula is the world path's with one matrix per rigid mover, the pose
is a 24-byte slice of the instanced-mesh record EDVR already decodes, and
the scene depth's own stencil can carry the tag. The same question, three
of its costs since measured; nothing built.*

**Performantly: yes.** The pass is one compute dispatch per eye over the
eye image, a handful of taps per pixel; believed a fraction of a
millisecond per eye at Quest-3 sizes, measured by timestamp query in Phase
0 and printed. That is cheaper than any supersampling players already run
against the same shimmer, and the two compose — a calmer image at a lower
HMD Quality is the trade this feature exists to offer.

**"Elite-specific" is the frame anatomy, not the filter.** The temporal
pass is the industry's; what makes it Elite's is everything this document
decides around it: filtering after the HUD so the hairlines are treated,
resetting on the flash withhold, running wide under the cull guard, the
on-foot panel's behaviour, the theater and heal paths, the game's own AA
detected by its passes, and feature D for the specular sparkle that even
a temporal pass leaves during motion. That is the "super-tuned" part, and
it is the part only something living where EDVR lives can do.

## What the plumbing opens: DLSS, and FSR 2

The question follows naturally: with a jittered render, a named depth
buffer and camera-derived motion vectors in hand, is DLSS within reach?
Yes. Those three, plus the jitter offsets and the projection, are the
input contract of DLSS Super Resolution, and DLAA is the same feature at a
render scale of 1.0. NGX exposes it to D3D11 applications through the
`NVSDK_NGX_D3D11_*` entry points (vendor-stated, the SDK's headers), so
nothing about Elite being D3D11 stands in the way. What the plumbing does
not change:

- **NVIDIA RTX only.** Turing and later — the same slice performance.md's
  foveation serves; a capability check at init and one log line where it
  cannot run.
- **The motion vectors are still camera-derived.** DLSS is trained on true
  per-pixel vectors and offers no clamp of EDVR's to tune: where the
  vectors are wrong — a passing ship, an NPC — it ghosts in its own way,
  and the remedy is the injection mods' remedy, a reactive mask or living
  with it. Feature B's own pass keeps that trade in EDVR's hands, which is
  why it comes first.
- **The input is post-HUD LDR.** The programming guide wants DLSS before
  UI compositing and prefers linear HDR input (vendor-stated); the door
  hands it a tonemapped frame with the HUD already on it. That is how every
  injected DLSS runs, and it works, out of spec — a Phase 0 look at the
  HUD's text is the price of knowing how well.
- **No frame generation.** It is D3D12 and Vulkan only (vendor-stated),
  and it is not wanted in a headset anyway, where the runtime already
  reprojects and latency is the thing being protected.
- **Licensing.** The SDK's binaries ship under NVIDIA's RTX SDKs licence,
  believed to permit redistribution inside an application on its terms;
  the licence text decides, and it would travel alongside the way
  `src/d3d11/fsr/README.md` carries AMD's and performance.md proposes for
  NVAPI's.

**What it would be worth.** The prize is not the anti-aliasing — feature B
is that, on every vendor — but performance.md's feature 1: at a render
scale of 0.67–0.75 a temporal reconstruction is in a different class from
FSR 1's spatial one, and DLSS is the best of them. On RTX hardware it
would become the preferred engine behind `render_scale`, with DLAA the
preferred engine at 1.0, both behind the same door and the same settings.
FSR 2 (MIT, with a D3D11 backend believed from 2.2) is the every-vendor
engine of the same shape — a step behind in quality, a step ahead in
tunability — and rides identical plumbing.

**The order, therefore.** Feature B's own pass first: all vendors, the
clamp in hand, the smallest change to measure the plumbing against. Then,
with Phase 0 items 3–5 answered (depth, camera, jitter — the same three
measurements DLSS needs), DLSS as the RTX engine behind the door and FSR 2
as the every-vendor one, each an engine choice on the existing setting
(`temporal_aa = edvr | dlss | fsr2`) rather than a new feature. Cost
believed about a millisecond per eye at Quest-3 sizes for DLSS, measured
before it ships, and repaid many times over by the pixels not rendered
when it is used as the upscaler.

## What it does for foveated rendering

Asked alongside the DLSS question: does any of this improve foveation?
Not the hardware side. performance.md's feature 2 is variable-rate
shading through NVAPI, NVIDIA-only on D3D11, and feature 3's gaze centre
is the runtime's own API; nothing here changes what either can reach. Two
things it does change:

- **It makes the rings pushable.** performance.md names VRS's failure
  mode itself: coarse shading of the deferred lighting and post shows as
  peripheral shimmer. A temporal pass at the door is the standard
  companion to VRS for exactly that reason — engines ship the two
  together, and the accumulation hides the coarser rate (believed; it is
  standard practice). With the jitter, the coarse region is even partly
  recovered over frames. Same look at coarser rates, or a calmer
  periphery at the same rates: better foveation on the hardware that has
  it, at no cost to the rings' design.
- **It opens an every-vendor foveation the performance doc declined for
  lack of a D3D11 VRS path.** A radial density mask — Valve's technique
  from The Lab, shipped for non-NVIDIA GPUs by vrperfkit (believed) —
  discards a checkerboard of peripheral pixels before shading, by a depth
  or stencil mask laid ahead of the game's draws, and fills them back at
  the door. From outside, the fill is a door pass of exactly feature A's
  shape; and with the mask alternating each frame, feature B's history
  fills the holes temporally instead of spatially — checkerboard rendering
  of the periphery, reconstructed by the pass that already exists. Two
  honest caveats: the savings on a deferred renderer are smaller than
  VRS's, since a full-screen lighting resolve skips only where the mask
  reaches its stencil (believed; vrperfkit's field experience says as
  much), and laying the mask means a per-draw depth-stencil intervention
  on the hot path, which this project spends reluctantly. A Phase 0
  question — the census can name the passes the mask would have to reach —
  not a promise.

The eye-tracked centre is unchanged. A foveated *resolve* — full-quality
temporal filtering at the fovea, cheaper in the periphery — was noted here
as a small saving the same gaze point could drive. It is no longer small:
NVIDIA's pass measured 2.7 ms per eye on the Pimax at HMD Quality 1.0,
scaling with output size, and running it on a crop around the gaze point
recovers most of that. It is designed as performance.md's feature 6, DLSS
where you look, with the runtime's sub-rectangle inputs, and the gaze
probe that decides which headsets can drive it was built
(`advanced.gaze_probe`, 2026-09-04) but has no native-path
implementation — deferred from parity, not abandoned.

## Considered and declined

- **Conservative rasterisation from the proxy** (D3D11.3, rewriting the
  game's rasteriser states at creation so a triangle lights every pixel
  it touches). Built and flown 2026-09-03 against the main-menu seam: the
  dashes did not change, and other surfaces grew triangle-shaped
  artifacts from the extrapolated attributes. The seam is not a geometry
  sliver, and the mechanism is not a fix even where it would be. Reverted
  the same day.

- **A ReShade preset instead.** ReShade has applied effects in the
  headset since 5.0 — a separate VR effect runtime, configured from the
  SteamVR dashboard (vendor-stated, the 5.0 release notes) — and it runs
  alongside EDVR (README). What it can do today: sharpening, and temporal
  effects driven by *estimated* motion, the optical-flow helpers of the
  Launchpad class computing per-pixel motion from colour and depth
  (believed, from their documentation). What it cannot do: jitter the
  projection, know each eye's true projection, or read the game's camera;
  its depth is found by heuristic. A ReShade anti-shimmer is therefore
  feature B's v1 with estimated motion and no jitter — a smoother whose
  ghosting-versus-flicker trade is set by the estimate's quality. Players
  who want to try one today can; the case for building it into EDVR is the
  jitter and the truths EDVR already holds. (For the record, of the two
  injection families the proposal cites: OptiScaler swaps one upscaler for
  another in games that already feed one, and the from-scratch matrix
  extraction is the per-game work of the PureDark-style mods — believed,
  from their own compatibility notes.)
- **A post-process AA pass of EDVR's own** (SMAA, CMAA2, FXAA — all
  permissively licensed and small). It would duplicate what the game's
  menu already offers, and the argument above is that the offering is the
  wrong kind, not a poor instance of the right one. Its one plausible role
  is as the spatial half of feature B (SMAA T2x's shape), which is a
  tuning question for after B exists.
- **A vendored temporal upscaler as the starting point** — DLSS or FSR 2
  before EDVR's own pass. Declined for the reasons in the section above:
  the plumbing is measured against the pass whose every knob is EDVR's,
  and the engines follow it.
- **MSAA for the HUD only.** Above; feasible, expensive, subsumed.
- **Driver-level overrides.** Do nothing on this renderer, as above; the
  guidance says so rather than sending players to try them.
- **Lying about the size to the runtime.** Everything here edits the
  game's answers and submits at the size the runtime asked for, the
  guard's posture; the runtime never learns anything changed.

## The order at the door

With performance.md's features, the treatment inside the one submit lambda
is, in order: **temporal AA** (on the game's texture, at render size, wide
if the guard is live) → **crop** (the guard) → **scale** (EASU up for
`render_scale` below 1.0; the supersample resolve down for above it) →
**sharpen** (RCAS) → **menu, toasts, monitor** composited onto the
native-size outgoing frame. Fusions come later, in the order their edge-tap
questions are answered; v1 may run them sequentially, since each already
exists or is one dispatch. Built so far (2026-09-03): temporal AA, the
crop, the supersample resolve (retired 2026-09-16) and the sharpen,
sequential, each its own pass on the texture the one before produced;
the fusions are noted in the code as future work.

## The tracker never rests: the rest lock (shipped 2026-09-03, retired 2026-09-04)

*Measured 2026-09-03 on a Pimax Crystal Super; the instruments and the
numbers are in the vr log's pose history, which since that day records the
rotation as well as the position.*

The shimmer on the main menu's ship — its near-horizontal hull lines
flickering with the head held still, on both headsets, with the game's AA
off and with SMAA, at HMD Quality 1.0 and 1.5, through the resolve at every
width and through a build with no EDVR image pass at all — turned out to
have one cause, and it is not in any filter:

- **The reported pose moves while the headset does not.** With the headset
  lying on a desk, the runtime's reported position held to under 0.05 mm a
  frame, and its reported orientation wandered about 0.1 arcmin a frame,
  with a step above 0.6 arcmin (half a rendered pixel at the centre of the
  eye) about once a second. A one-pixel line blinks as that wander walks it
  across pixel rows; a diagonal line only slides its own stair pattern along
  itself, which is invisible — the field's observation that rolling the
  head about 25 degrees removes the shimmer.
- **It is applied twice.** The game renders from the wandering pose, and
  the compositor then re-warps every frame from the pose it believes the
  frame was rendered from to the pose it predicts at display, so a frame
  rendered from a held pose still blinks in the headset. The game's mirror
  window, which shows the eye as rendered, does not.
- **Nothing downstream can remove it,** because the motion is real: the
  resolve at calm 2.0, the compositor's own sampler and any post filter all
  pass a moving line faithfully.

**The fix, `experimental.shimmer_rest`** (`src/openvr/compositor_hook.cpp`,
`src/common/rest_math.h`): the pose handed to the game moves toward the
tracker's pose by a factor k each frame — 0.02 at and under 0.6 arcmin a
frame of smoothed head motion (a half-second time constant that passes the
slow wander and takes the jitter down fifty times), 1 at and over 2.0 —
and every submit while k < 1 carries `Submit_TextureWithPose` with a pose
that slides with the same k between the frame's predicted display pose
(nothing to re-warp) and its render pose (the stock warp, latency
compensation intact). Both eyes are told the same pose each frame, since
SteamVR keeps only the later submit's. Proven first as an instrument
(`advanced.pose_hold = headset`) and then as the continuous form, at the
main menu, in the headset, on native SteamVR. Under OpenComposite the
game-side half works regardless; whether the submit-time pose reaches the
OpenXR projection layer is unverified.

**What it exposed.** With the view held, the seam that used to shimmer
shows a row of bright dashes that get finer and more frequent as HMD
Quality rises and merge when the head tilts: a feature narrower than a
pixel, sampled once per pixel, lit wherever the sample lands on it. The
geometry reading was tested and failed: every solid-fill rasteriser state
the game creates rewritten with D3D11.3 conservative rasterisation (tier
3, eight states, all cull modes) left the dashes unchanged and put
triangle-shaped artifacts on other surfaces, so the seam is texture-space
detail — most likely a normal-map ridge's specular, or a one-texel bright
line — sampled at the render grid's phase. What a single sample skipped is
not in the image, and no filter at the door can recover it. The levers are
the ones this document already names: more samples per pixel, feature C's
LOD bias and feature D's specular anti-aliasing for the texture side, and
feature B's temporal accumulation, whose history the rest lock finally
registers exactly while the head is still.

**Retired the day after it merged (2026-09-04).** Two facts decided it.
The temporal pass integrates the tracker's wander instead of fighting it:
under the jitter and a registered history the wander is one more sub-pixel
sample, and on the trained path NVIDIA's history handles it outright, so a
held pose bought nothing the pass was not already buying. And the lock
could not engage on the headset that needed it most: the Quest 3's
tracking floors at 1.9 arcminutes a frame against a 0.6 threshold, held
zero of 15,569 frames, and raising the threshold produced a jerkiness
worse than the shimmer. The key, its two thresholds, the pose half and the
compositor half are gone; `advanced.pose_hold`, the instrument that
proved the mechanism, is retired too as of 2026-09-16, with the rest of
the legacy OpenVR backend. The measurements above stand as the record
of what the tracker does.

## Guidance for players now

Feature A ships (`auto` by default since 2026-09-03); the rest lock above
shipped the same day and was retired on 2026-09-04; feature B is on its
branch.
Some of the shimmer has answers today, and the README and `edvr.ini` have
carried them since the same date:

- **Supersample through HMD Quality, not Elite's Supersampling slider**,
  in VR. The first hands the compositor a bigger frame to filter down as
  part of its distortion pass; the second has the game filter down before
  its post chain sees the result (believed, and it is the field's settled
  advice). Feature A, switched on, makes the choice moot; with it off the
  compositor's filter is the better one.
- **On SteamVR, turn on Advanced Supersample Filtering** (in the
  advanced video settings). It is the better downsample, and by its own
  description it is only noticeable at high supersampling — which is
  where VR players of this game already are.
- **Set Elite's anti-aliasing to Off or SMAA, and stop expecting it to
  address flicker.** It costs nearly nothing either way; it is not the
  lever.
- **Anisotropic filtering at 16x**, in the game's own menu, for surfaces
  at grazing angles — planet terrain at altitude especially.
- **The temporal pass**, `temporal_aa = dlaa` on an RTX card and `on`
  elsewhere, if a steady ship's lines flicker with your head still: the
  rest lock that once addressed them is retired (above), and the pass
  integrates the wander it was built to hold.

## Phase 0 — what must be measured, not assumed

1. **The menu options, under the census.** One flight per AA option,
   watching for `SampleDesc.Count > 1` at creation and `V` lines in a
   census: turns "believed post-process" into measured, and collects the
   SMAA/FXAA pass hashes feature B's warning line needs.
2. **The eye-texture formats** (shared with performance.md's item 1): the
   exact formats submitted, sRGB or not, for the resolve's and the TAA's
   views. *Measured 2026-09-02 by the resolve's `first resolved frame`
   line: R8G8B8A8_TYPELESS (DXGI_FORMAT 27) on the Pimax Crystal Super
   over native SteamVR, submitted as gamma content; the render-scale work
   measured the same format on the Quest 3 over Virtual Desktop the same
   day. Both rigs agree; the sRGB-typed variants have not been seen.*
3. **The depth target.** Its format, whether it is created with
   shader-resource binding, and that the classifier names the same target
   the eye draws bind — one census with `d=` against one `CreateTexture2D`
   log.
4. **The camera buffer's contents.** Whether the buffer the flash detector
   reads carries the full view (or view-projection) matrix per eye, which
   decides whether v2 of feature B's reprojection is a read or a search.
5. **Jitter through the lie path.** That the game renders through the
   shifted projection the same frame it is told it (the ~1080/s query rate
   suggests per-frame reads, but the frame the values land in is a
   measurement), and which draws do not follow it — the un-jittered
   full-screen class, found by a jitter A/B with the census running.
6. **Price and softness.** Timestamp queries for both passes on both rigs;
   and a held-view comparison — the tile-difference method
   `docs/eye-brightness.md` used — of native, supersampled-bilinear,
   supersampled-resolved, and TAA, so "sharper" and "calmer" are numbers.
   *The resolve's price is measured: 0.48 ms per eye on average, max
   0.80, resolving 6780x6695 to 5424x5356 on the Pimax (2026-09-02), and
   0.09 ms per eye, max 0.48, resolving 3096x3312 to 2064x2208 on the
   Quest 3 (2026-09-03), calm kernel at radius 1.0 both times — timestamp
   queries around its two dispatches, printed after 120 samples and in the
   totals line. Softness is not, and the held-view comparison is still to
   be flown.*
7. **The HUD under TAA.** Text legibility with jitter on and off, and
   ghosting on a passing ship at the default clamp: the two failure modes
   that would decide the defaults.
8. **The resolve kernel's edge behaviour under the crop** —
   performance.md's item 2, which now has two consumers.
9. **Which passes feature D would need to cover**, if it is ever built:
   the census's list of lighting draws beyond the one resolve.
10. **NGX on the target GPUs**, when the engine choice is built: init and
    per-eye feature creation on D3D11, the flags for a post-HUD LDR input,
    the HUD's text under it, and the price — measured the way NVAPI's
    caps are in performance.md's item 4.
11. **The density mask's reach**, if every-vendor foveation is pursued:
    which passes a peripheral depth/stencil mask actually skips on this
    renderer (the census names them), the saving it buys against VRS's,
    and the temporal fill's look at the ring boundary.

## Phasing

1. **Feature A, passive** — **built 2026-09-02, field-verified on both
   rigs and `auto` by default from 2026-09-03**: the resolve at the door,
   arming itself when the game submits larger than asked, with the
   guidance text in the README and `edvr.ini`. Small, all vendors, and it
   built the door machinery every later pass uses.
2. **Feature C** — a day's work whenever a slot is free; it does not wait
   on anything.
3. **Feature B v1** (head-motion reprojection, with the jitter), then
   **v2** (the game's camera, once Phase 0 item 4 answers). This is the
   feature the ask is really about, and it goes second only because A's
   door and Phase 0's measurements make it a smaller, better-instrumented
   change.
4. **Feature A, active** — `render_scale` above 1.0 — once performance.md's
   feature 1 has the size-lie choreography in place for the direction
   below 1.0; the two share every line but the factor.
5. **Feature D**, if and only if residual specular sparkle is measured
   after 3.
6. **DLSS and FSR 2 as engines behind the door**, once 3's plumbing is
   measured — DLSS first, by the size of its win as the upscaler on RTX
   hardware, and as performance.md's feature 1 gains a temporal engine.

Each off by default, each with its own stand-down and its price in the
log. None of it reads or writes game memory or code: the passes treat
frames at the door, the jitter and the size are edited answers the guard
already edits, the LOD bias is a number added to a description on its way
to the driver. A player who wants none of it leaves the settings at their
defaults and runs a build identical in behaviour to today's.

## What the pass costs, and one thing it was wasting (2026-09-06)

Turning the pass off at native took a Crystal Super frame from 13.3 ms to
8.2, so at that resolution it is about forty percent of the frame: 2.80 ms
an eye by its own totals, of which NVIDIA's evaluation is 1.75 and the rest
is the work around it -- a full-frame copy in so NVIDIA has a typed texture
to read, one compute dispatch over every pixel for the motion vectors and
the depth copy, and a full-frame copy out so the compositor gets the game's
own format back and can view it as sRGB.

Reading that path found something that should never have been in it. Both
the motion-vector shader and the own-history one ended by flushing forty
diagnostic counters with forty global atomic adds per thread group,
unconditionally, onto forty contended addresses. At 4336x4284 with 8x8
groups that is 290,512 groups an eye: **11.6 million atomic adds an eye,
23 million a frame**, for a set of numbers that only the registration log
line reads. The motion-vector shader also carried a forty-element counter
array per thread while writing three of them, forty registers of occupancy
on a dispatch covering 18.6 megapixels.

A counter that did not move is no longer flushed, which is exactly
behaviour-preserving -- adding zero is a no-op -- and the shader keeps its
three real counters. Measured in flight the next morning, the same scenes:

| The pass, per eye | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Total | 2.80 ms | 2.02 ms |
| NVIDIA's evaluation | 1.75 | 1.72 |
| EDVR's own work around it | 1.05 | 0.30 |

About 1.5 ms a frame, on every rig running the pass, for a change that
alters no pixel. What is left of our own share is the two full-frame copies
and the dispatch's real work. Both copies are avoidable in principle -- the
one in only because the game's texture may be typeless where NVIDIA needs a
typed view, the one out only because the compositor needs the game's format
to make an sRGB view, which telling Submit the colour space outright would
also solve -- but at 0.3 ms an eye they are no longer the place to look.

The wider lesson is the one the foveation arc kept relearning: measure the
frame before optimising a part of it. A diagnostic in a per-pixel shader is
part of the frame.

## The own resolve ships instrumented (2026-09-16)

A supporter's flight (v0.17.0-rc.3, RTX 4080 SUPER, SteamVR/OpenXR Meta
compatibility, 2160x2290 per eye, HMD Quality 1.0) priced the own history
at 2.26-2.75 ms per stereo pair (median) against DLSS-as-DLAA's ~3.0 (prep
0.55-0.75, NGX 2.1-2.3, ui 0.25) -- it should have beaten that by more.

Cause: `main` (fix.temporal_aa = on) compiles with no macro, so
temporal_shader_source.h's default `#define EDVR_TEMPORAL_DIAGNOSTICS 1`
always applies. Its candidate loop is gated only by `candMask`; unlike
`mv` (motionShader), it had no fast/diagnostic pair. Every frame paid for
four extra candidate reprojections per pixel ("counted and not used"), a
5x5 SAD probe every 64 pixels, and 48 per-thread counters flushed through
groupshared atomics -- none touching an output pixel.

| main (cs_5_0) | instr | sample_l | ld | atomics | temps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| macro=1 (shipped) | ~3966 | 64 | 264 | 39 | 51 |
| macro=0 (guarded) | ~1950 | 28 | 129 | 0 | 30 |

Fix: tools/temporal_shader_build compiles temporal_aa_fast_cs (macro=0)
beside the instrumented temporal_aa_cs; temporal_pass.cpp's ownShader()
mirrors motionShader() and picks by advanced.temporal_aa_diagnostics; the
two blocks above are now #if EDVR_TEMPORAL_DIAGNOSTICS. Price-window
labels say "own history (no ngx, lean)" or "(..., instrumented)"; the
totals line says plainly when rejection/clipping went uncounted rather
than print a false 0%. No output pixel changes by construction.

Built, not flown. Flight: fly fix.temporal_aa = on, read the "lean" price
line, then flip advanced.temporal_aa_diagnostics to 1 live and read the
"instrumented" one, same scene. Hypothesis: ~2.4 ms per pair drops toward
1.2-1.6. If so, the next candidates -- only after this measurement -- are
the 27-load three-source depth dilation, the 9-tap Catmull-Rom history,
and the UI history read/write.

## DLSS mode selection hardened (2026-09-23)

A supporter's flight (edvr_gfx_20260923_092848.log) line 658, 09:29:10.213:
"dlaa was asked for, but a 1229x1412 frame sits outside every DLSS mode's
render range for a 3070x3032 output. The pass's own history runs instead."
-- a 40% input against an output whose ultra performance mode (one third)
should have held it. 54 ms later (line 668) the output changed to
2458x2824 and the SAME input created fine, at exactly 50%, performance
mode, range 1229x1412..2458x2824 (min = the mode's own optimal size, max
= the output). Sean separately reported HMD Quality 0.5 "disengaging
DLSS," not reproduced that day: a 1535x1516 -> 3070x3032 feature created
at exactly 50%, range 1535x1516..3070x3032 -- the input exactly at the
range's minimum.

Cause, on the evidence available (the old code printed only the chosen
mode's own range, never the other three, so this could not be settled
outright): `ensureFeature`'s ladder walk (dlaa.cpp, then ~296-347) queried
NGX_DLSS_GET_OPTIMAL_SETTINGS for quality, balanced, performance and
ultra performance in order and `break`s on the first query that fails.
Quality's query answering but not holding a 40% input, followed by
balanced's query failing, would break the walk before performance or
ultra performance -- which the evidence says should have held it -- were
ever tried. `evaluateCrop`'s separate ratio selection (~675-681) used a
different threshold (no epsilon, 0.66 vs. 0.667) from ensureFeature's own
ratio fallback, so the same ratio could pick different modes depending
which call site saw it.

Fix (dlaa.h/dlaa.cpp):
- The query loop never breaks: all four modes are always queried, each
  recorded ok/failed, and logged ONCE per output size --
  `dlss: modes for WxH: quality W2xH2 (minW2xH2..maxW2xH2), balanced ...,
  performance ..., ultra performance ...` (a failed query prints its NGX
  code instead of a range) -- so a refusal is always explained without a
  second flight for better logging. If this code never ran on a given
  output size, no such line appears for it; the old single-range refusal
  text is the only sign that would remain.
- Selection (dlaa.h, `dlssChooseMode`): among modes whose [min,max] holds
  the input (>=/<= both ends, so exactly-at-minimum stays put), the
  nearest optimal wins, as before. If none holds it but a query failed,
  the ladder is incomplete, not a real "no": the nearest mode by ratio is
  picked and NGX's create call decides (its own failure path already
  logs the NGX result). Only when all four queries succeeded and truly
  none holds the input does this refuse -- and now the message carries
  all four ranges, not just the one that was checked last.
- One ratio helper (`dlssModeByRatio`) replaces the two that had drifted
  apart; both ensureFeature's range-unknown fallback and evaluateCrop's
  per-frame ratio call it, epsilon and all (the 2026-09-05 review, F1: an
  exact half stays on performance, not ultra performance).
- A create success (ensureFeature and evaluateCrop) now resets the shared
  `g_reason` to "available". It had no reset on success at all: a
  ladder-walk refusal at one output size could outlive its own cause and
  still be the string a later `dlaaAvailable(dev, &reason)` call hands
  back (temporal_pass.cpp:5529, 5977) even after a later size change
  fixed it. The read side already re-reads g_reason fresh on every call
  (confirmed by inspection); this was purely a stale-write bug.

Rig: `tools\dlaa_mode_test` (registered in build.bat, no NGX SDK or device
needed -- DlssModeRange/dlssModeByRatio/dlssChooseMode are SDK-free, in
dlaa.h). Fixture ladders for both outputs above, built from the field's
own rule (min = a mode's optimal, max = the output); asserts the
exact-minimum and one-pixel-short cases on both outputs at all six sizes
(1535x1516, 1534x1516, 1229x1412, 1228x1411, 1023x1010, 1022x1010), a
mid-ladder query hole that must not hide a lower mode, the all-failed and
partial-failure ratio fallbacks with no fabricated range, nearest-optimal
selection when every mode holds the input, and that a genuine floor
(1022x1010 against 3070x3032, one pixel below even ultra performance's
minimum with every query answering) still refuses.

Not flown: the fix addresses what the log evidence and the code both
support (the break, the two ratio rules, the stale reason), but no flight
yet carries the "modes for WxH" line. Next flight: read it at the
09:29:10 output size and confirm which query, if any, was the one that
failed that day.

## The served floor: the output follows the input (2026-09-23)

Sean: "setting HMD Quality 0.5 causes DLSS to disengage." The first flight
to carry the modes line (edvr_gfx_20260923_153446.log, v0.17.0-451, Pimax
Crystal Super at `openxr_resolution` 4074 = 4074x4076, RTX 5090, preset K)
names the floor exactly, line 435:
`dlss: modes for 4074x4076: quality 2716x2717 (2037x2038..4074x4076),
balanced 2363x2364 (2037x2038..4074x4076), performance 2037x2038
(2037x2038..4074x4076), ultra performance 1358x1359 (1358x1359..1358x1359)`.
The three upper modes share one floor at half the output; ultra
performance's range is a single point at a third. Every input between a
third and a half of the output, and every input under a third, is served
by no mode. HMD Quality 0.5 sits exactly on the floor (2037x2038 in,
created fine, line 436); a pixel under it, a 0.45 setting, or the trim's
two-step adoption (092848, 09:29:10: 1229x1412 against a still-untrimmed
3070x3032, 40%) falls into the hole, and the pass runs its own history.

ruled out: a failed mid-ladder query hid the mode that would have served
the 40% input (the hardening's cause above), because the 15:34 line has
all four queries answering and no range between a third and a half.

The selection refuses correctly there; the fix is the OUTPUT the pass is
asked for. The door's output is chosen in native_temporal.cpp's treat():
the host's recommendation (`recW x recH`, the runtime's treatedGeometry)
whenever dlss upscales. Now, for NVIDIA only, `floorOutput` asks NGX for
that output's four ranges (`dlssModeRanges`, dlaa.cpp: ensureFeature's
query, its walk and selection untouched), and where no mode serves the
input, cuts the output to the largest one, at or under the door's, that a
mode's floor lets the input reach -- per axis input x door / floor, made
even (dlss_floor.h, SDK-free): twice the input on the flights' ranges.
NGX's own answer at the cut has the last word: while the input still
misses the floor there, that axis steps down two pixels (eight steps at
most). Decided when the door's output or the input changes, never per
frame; undone when the input rises back; NGX silent or no served cut:
the door's output stands, as before. FSR is untouched.

What keys on the door's output follows it by itself: the runtime's submit
blit samples whatever the door hands into the full swapchain, or the
trim's placement viewport, with the same field of view
(src/openxr/d3d11_stereo.cpp: the rest of the way is a bilinear
upsample); the UI layer re-sizes from the door's texture
(ui_layer.cpp, "the door hands on"); the sharpen and EDVR's menu run on
the texture they are handed; the eye capture copies any size; the price
lines print the pass's output. One reader did not: the mip-bias check
(temporal_pass.cpp) divided the input by the output, so a cut at 0.45
would have printed "they DISAGREE ... only a restart can fix it"; it now
divides by the recommendation Elite was told.

Rigs: `dlaa_mode_test` 61 checks (28 before): the logged line as the
fixture, number for number, and the rule at 4074x4076 for 2037, 2036,
1833, 1358 (point and off it), 1300; at 3070x3032 for 1535, 1534, 1229
(the transient, cut to 2458x2824, the very door the promotion hands
next); odd doors cut even. `native_temporal_test` 345 (230 before): the
same sizes through treat(), NGX asked once per change, a stingier floor
stepped down (3656x3658 for 1831x1832), NGX silent at the cut, FSR.

Log signature (not flown). The rule firing at HMD Quality 0.45:
`dlss floor: the game's 1833x1834 is under the 2037x2038 floor NVIDIA
names for a 4074x4076 output, where no mode serves it; the pass outputs
3666x3668 (2.00x the input, ...)`, then `dlss: modes for 3666x3668`,
`dlss: the feature is created for eye 0, 1833x1834 in and 3666x3668 out
(50% per axis), the performance mode`, `the left eye's door hands on
3666x3668`, and `floor_cuts=` above 0 in the totals; back at 0.5, `...
reaches the floor of the 4074x4076 output again`. If the rule never
fired: `temporal aa: dlaa was asked for, but a 1833x1834 frame sits
outside every DLSS mode's render range for a 4074x4076 output (...). The
pass's own history runs instead.` and the door handing on 1833x1834.
