# The in-headset settings menu: a design

## Status

*Updated 2026-09-15. Historical findings summarize the journal below; the
current timing and overlay qualification is linked separately.*

- **2026-09-24:** the Performance page's Foveation centre row is gone
  with its key (`experimental.foveation_centre`, retired).
- **2026-09-23, later:** the Monitor page drops the rows the compositor's
  frame timing filled -- DROPPED, BY CAUSE and REPROJECTED always, APP GPU
  and GPU TIME off the native path -- instead of showing "--" for good:
  that timing crossed from the legacy openvr half, and frame_flag v34
  retired the channel nothing had written since the proxy went. The drop
  log line and the last-drop line speak of long frames only.
- **2026-09-23:** the Performance page's `UI quality` row (`fix.ui_quality`)
  is one row for the cockpit panels' size and the UI layer; the one-day
  `HUD quality` row is gone (see the journal's dated entries). Its choices
  read off / 100% / 125% (the file's `off | 100 | 125`).
- **Current change:** The smaller single-line overlay fits its displayed text and keeps its font size across
  OpenXR resolutions and shows application GPU/CPU elapsed timings. Full
  desktop gates passed; headset checks remain in the
  [combined test guide](native-render-benchmark-2026-09-15.md).
- **State:** Supersedes and extends Feature 4 of performance.md
  (2026-09-05), which now points here. Written 2026-09-07 on branch
  `claude/ingame-settings-menu-78317d` off main `5e2d545`; claims are
  marked MEASURED (desk or field log) or BELIEVED (inference, gated in
  "Phase 0"). Phase A (the menu) was BUILT and UNFLOWN per the 2026-09-07
  status note, then FLOWN that evening on a Pimax Crystal Super under
  SteamVR — panel holds still, keys private, rows write the ini — and
  has taken fixes through 2026-09-11 (see Detail). The 2026-09-07 claim
  that every Phase 0 gate was open is not revisited later, though gates
  get dated measurements below.
- **Open:**
  - The four items under "Open questions for Sean" (F8 vs a chord as
    summon key; `keyboard = private` as default; where `developer`
    lives; which `[fix]` rows get the `menu` token) — "Settings sketch"
    already ships F8 and `private`, so those two may be settled without
    this section saying so.
  - Whether the 2026-09-10 DirectInput8Create-capture fix (see Ruled
    out) has itself been confirmed by a flight is not stated.
  - Phase 0 gates with no dated measurement here: G4 (GDI cost and
    legibility), G6 (`aim = both` tuning), G11 (focus/Alt-Tab), G14 (the
    leak audit).
- **Ruled out:**
  - The shared-DirectInput-vtable door, on the Steam install: the menu
    reported "keys private" while Tab still reached the ship
    (2026-09-08), confirmed by a 2026-09-10 flight log — fixed by
    capturing `DirectInput8Create` itself instead of a shared table.
  - `menu.aim = both` as default: "fought the keys" in the first flight
    (2026-09-07) — `keys` ships as the default instead.
  - Reading `Compositor_FrameTiming` at the modern struct's offsets: it
    is really the 176-byte v0.9.20 layout ("cost four flights and two
    wrong answers"); two claims are explicitly retracted ("Elite calls
    WaitGetPoses thirty microseconds before it submits", "the app's GPU
    time reads 0.2 ms").
  - The climbing "with EDVR" drop count on the second flight (2026-09-07):
    a ring-buffer bug (record written to the wrong entry), not real
    menu-caused drops.
- **Environment:** The DirectInput8Create fix is stated
  runtime-independent ("applies to both SteamVR and OpenComposite"); the
  first flight (2026-09-07) was a Pimax Crystal Super under SteamVR;
  later entries (2026-09-08 on) say "the Steam copy" or "Sean's rig"
  without restating the headset. The shared-vtable door held on the
  install tested first but not the Steam copy, where Steam's overlay may
  hand out private per-device tables.
- **Detail:** "The keyboard gate" for the three doors and fail-open
  rules; "Navigation and interaction" for the DirectInput finding, the
  footer fix, "Your Elite keys (2026-09-11)" and the Tab-follows-page-pair
  fix; "What it shows" for the Monitor page's `Compositor_FrameTiming`
  finding; "Phase 0 -- what must be measured before code depends on it"
  for gates G1-G14; "Open questions for Sean"; "Phasing" for phases A/B/C.
- **2026-09-23:** `fix.settlement_detail` added to the Performance page's
  row list below, alongside its promotion to a first-class fix (README,
  docs/fixes.md). The `# ui:` annotation that generates its row for the
  running menu and the installer's settings window landed with the
  governor's refinements the same day (`Settlement detail | choices game,
  auto=Auto, reduced | live | menu performance`); its two [advanced]
  tuning keys appear only in the developer tier.
- **2026-09-23:** `fix.hud_quality` added to the Performance page's row
  list below (`HUD quality | choices off, 1.0=HMD Quality 1.0,
  1.25=HMD Quality 1.25 | live | menu performance`, docs/hud-quality-2026-09-23.md).
  Generalises `advanced.surface_inflate`'s developer-tier mechanism
  (fss_res.cpp) to a size the interface-depth pass's own classifier learns
  (gated on `fix.temporal_aa`) and a float factor derived from the game's
  live HMD Quality, instead of a named
  `WxH` and an integer 2..4. BUILT, NOT FLOWN -- gate G9
  (`crisp-ui-handoff.md`) is still open for every inflation mechanism.
- **2026-09-23:** `fix.ui_quality` added to the Performance page's row list
  below (`UI quality | choices off, 1.0=HMD Quality 1.0, 1.25=HMD Quality
  1.25 | live | menu performance`, docs/ui-layer-2026-09-23.md): the game's
  post-tonemap UI drawn into a per-eye layer after the upscale (Design A of
  `crisp-ui-handoff.md`, phase 1). `advanced.temporal_aa_debug` gains the
  developer-tier value `ui_layer`. BUILT, NOT FLOWN.
- **2026-09-23 (later):** the `HUD quality` row is gone -- one key,
  `fix.ui_quality`, now drives both the cockpit panels' size and the layer
  (docs/ui-layer-2026-09-23.md); `fix.hud_quality` is no longer read.
  `advanced.ui_replay` (on | off, developer tier) is the A/B for the deferred
  UI replay of the cockpit HUD.
- **2026-09-23 (later still):** `advanced.ui_replay` is gone with the
  deferred UI replay it switched (retired the same day, 48ad7689): the
  developer tier no longer has the row, and the cockpit HUD stays in the
  picture the upscaler reconstructs.

*A design document, written before the code. It supersedes and extends
Feature 4 of [performance.md](performance.md) (2026-09-05), which stays as
the origin and now points here. Claims about EDVR cite the source; claims
about the game and about Windows are labelled MEASURED (established at the
desk or in a field log kept by this repo) or BELIEVED (inference, each with
a gate below that turns it into a measurement before code may depend on
it); what can only be settled with a headset on is collected under Phase 0.

`5e2d545`.*

## The ask

Sean, 2026-09-07: an in-game menu that lets players switch settings
quickly, "similar to what's in OpenXR Toolkit", fleshed out from the
Feature 4 sketch, with three additions:

1. **A developer key in the ini** that also exposes the advanced and
   experimental options.
2. **Keyboard input that does not pass through to the game.**
3. **The panel lives in 3D space**, not head-locked the way the toolkit's is.

And the same day: **flag which settings need a restart** when they are
changed.

## The short version

Feature 4 was built on one assumption it inherited from `hotkey.h`: EDVR
watches keys and cannot take them, so the menu must be driven by head-aim
and two carefully chosen chords that the game also receives. That was a
policy, not a fact. MEASURED at the desk today: Elite reads the keyboard
through exactly three doors, all of them in this process and all patchable
without a system-wide hook (the section "The keyboard gate"). So while the
menu is open **the game sees no keyboard at all** -- every key is released
from its point of view, and every press belongs to the menu. That single
change turns the whole toolkit navigation model on: arrows, Enter, Escape,
page keys, hold-to-repeat, and later typing a value, none of it colliding
with a ship binding. Head-aim stays, as the hands-free way to pick a row.

Everything else Feature 4 decided survives and is restated briefly:
world-anchored where you look, type sized in degrees, drawn last at the
door onto the native-size outgoing frame, every row wearing its measured
price, the ini as the single source of truth. Two things are new besides
the gate: a **developer tier** (`menu.developer = on`) that adds the
Advanced, Experimental and Instruments pages and shows the ini's own key
names beside the labels, and **restart flagging** that is enforced at build
time, shown on the row, counted in the footer, and repeated in the log.

## What the toolkit got wrong, restated as the brief

Head-locked text that rode every head movement; pixel-fixed type that came
out tiny on wide-FOV headsets; three chorded function keys to walk a tree,
chosen because an OpenXR layer cannot take keys from the game either; and
no sense of what a setting *cost* beyond watching the FPS counter wobble.
This design answers each: the panel stays in the world; text is specified
in degrees; the keyboard is the menu's while it is open, so the keys are
the obvious ones; and each row shows its measured cost.

## The keyboard gate

### What Elite reads (MEASURED 2026-09-07)

`dumpbin /IMPORTS` on `EliteDangerous64.exe` (the Steam install, the build
running on 2026-09-07):

| Module | Keyboard-relevant imports |
|---|---|
| `DINPUT8.dll` | `DirectInput8Create` |
| `USER32.dll` | `GetAsyncKeyState`, `GetKeyState`, `GetKeyboardState`, `PeekMessageA`, `TranslateMessage`, `DispatchMessageA`, `ToUnicodeEx`, `MapVirtualKeyExA`, `SetWindowsHookExA` |
| `XINPUT9_1_0.dll` | `XInputGetState`, `XInputSetState` |

Absent: `GetRawInputData`, `GetRawInputBuffer`, `RegisterRawInputDevices`,
and every `GetMessage` variant. Elite does not use Raw Input for the
keyboard (a static-import fact; a dynamic `GetProcAddress` of it would be a
surprise the probe below would catch as "a key that leaked"). The bindings
path is DirectInput: `hotkey.cpp` recorded on 2026-08-16 that Elite keeps
delivering bound keys while its window is not foreground, which only
DirectInput does. BELIEVED, from the import list's shape: the user32 trio
serves text fields and UI state, and the message pump's `WM_CHAR` (made by
`TranslateMessage` from `WM_KEYDOWN`) serves typing. `SetWindowsHookExA` is
BELIEVED to be the usual game-side low-level hook that disables the Windows
key; if it is instead a keyboard hook the game reads through, gate G3's
modal test is where that shows.

### Three doors, one flag

One atomic flag, `g_keyboardPrivate`, set by the menu when it is visible
and cleared when it is not. Three thin hooks consult it. Each is installed
once, on the menu's first use, and each degrades to pass-through on any
doubt.

**Door 1 -- DirectInput's keyboard device (the bindings path).**
`IDirectInputDevice8::GetDeviceState` (slot 9) and `GetDeviceData` (slot
10). EDVR reaches the game's device object without ever seeing it: it
calls `DirectInput8Create` itself, creates its own `GUID_SysKeyboard`
device, and patches that device's vtable **in place**. BELIEVED: every
device object dinput8.dll makes dispatches through the same static table,
so the game's keyboard device arrives at the same thunks (this is the
standard way overlays reach a game's DirectInput devices, and the
`vtable_hook.h` comment already states the consequence: "patching a vtable
hooks EVERY object of that class"). Gate G2 measures it: with the patch in,
count calls whose `this` is not ours; zero within ten seconds of play means
the table is not shared or the game reads elsewhere, and the door reports
"not reached".

Note the mechanism choice against `vtable_hook.h`'s own rule. That header
picks CopyVptr for a table inside the implementing module, because the
runtime re-points its own tables; here the shared table IS the mechanism --
CopyVptr on our dummy device would hook our dummy device and nothing else.
So this is InPlace, deliberately, with the header's costs accepted:
`reclaim()` runs on the frame path as for the context hooks, the `this`
check is in every thunk, and a foreign entry already in the slot is chained
through, not replaced. The Steam overlay is the foreign entry to expect:
BELIEVED to hook exactly these slots to block game input while it is shown;
the install log names which module each slot pointed at before EDVR
patched it (`dinput8.dll` on the Frontier install, presumably
`gameoverlayrenderer64.dll` on Steam's), which is gate G2's second half.

Only keyboard devices are filtered. The thunk asks each `this` once, through
the original `GetDeviceInfo`, whether it is `GUID_SysKeyboard`, and caches
the answer per object pointer (a small fixed table; an unknown object
passes through). A HOTAS, a throttle and pedals are DirectInput devices on
the same table and are never touched: **the ship keeps flying while the
menu is open**, which is a feature, not a limitation.

Two interfaces exist, `IDirectInputDevice8A` and `...8W`, with separate
tables. EDVR creates one device of each and patches both; the probe reports
which one the game's calls arrive on.

**Door 2 -- the user32 key-state trio.** `GetAsyncKeyState`, `GetKeyState`
and `GetKeyboardState`, patched in the game **executable's import table**
only (`src/common/iat_hook.h`, new: walk `GetModuleHandle(nullptr)`'s
import descriptors, find the user32 entries, exchange the pointers under
`VirtualProtect`, all-or-nothing with rollback, the discipline `vscreen_res`
uses for code patching). EDVR's own modules import these functions through
their own tables, so `hotkey.cpp`'s polling is unaffected and keeps reading
the real keyboard for the menu.

**Door 3 -- the message pump.** `PeekMessageA`, same IAT technique. When
the original returns a keyboard message (`WM_KEYDOWN`, `WM_KEYUP`,
`WM_SYSKEYDOWN`, `WM_SYSKEYUP`, `WM_CHAR`, `WM_SYSCHAR`, `WM_DEADCHAR`,
`WM_UNICHAR`) while the flag is set, the message is rewritten to `WM_NULL`
in place. No `WM_CHAR` is ever generated because no `WM_KEYDOWN` reaches
`TranslateMessage`. This is thread-agnostic, which is why it is preferred
over subclassing the window (`SetWindowSubclass` must run on the window's
thread, and whether the Present thread is that thread is unmeasured).
Side effect, accepted: Alt+F4 does not close the game while the menu is
open, since its `WM_SYSKEYDOWN` is nulled before `DefWindowProc` turns it
into `SC_CLOSE`.

### The policy: release everything, admit nothing

While the flag is set:

- `GetDeviceState` returns the device's real result code and a **zeroed
  buffer**: every key up. A key held at the moment the menu opens is seen
  released, which is what a modal dialog does and what lets the gate be
  used mid-thrust without leaving thrust latched.
- `GetDeviceData` returns the **key-up events and drops the key-downs**, so
  a key the game saw go down before the menu opened still gets its release
  and no internal toggle is left half-pressed.
- The user32 trio answers "up" for every key; `GetKeyboardState` zeroes its
  256 bytes.
- The pump's keyboard messages become `WM_NULL`.

The game never sees a chord it did not see start, and never sees a key
stuck down.

### The summon key is private too

The flag is not the only condition. The doors also swallow **the summon
key itself, whenever its chord is held, even with the menu closed** -- so
the game never sees the press that opens the menu, and the binding is
EDVR's alone. This costs one byte comparison per `GetDeviceState` call for
the whole session (the binding is pre-translated once, at configure, into a
DirectInput scan code with `MapVirtualKeyW(MAPVK_VK_TO_VSC)` plus the
extended-key bit for the cursor cluster, and stored as one packed word so a
live rebind cannot tear it). Where the translation is uncertain the swallow
is skipped for that key and the collision check below says so.

What this changes about Feature 4's collision check: it still reads the
player's actual bindings (`elite_binds`, extended with a reverse lookup
from key to element), but the warning now reads "your menu key masks Elite's
*X* while EDVR is installed" instead of "double-acts". A masked binding is
a milder failure than a double-acting one, and it is the player's own
choice of key that causes it.

### What is deliberately not captured

- **The mouse.** Never touched; the menu has no pointer.
- **DirectInput joysticks, throttles, pedals.** Never touched; the ship
  flies.
- **XInput pads, in v1.** `XInputGetState` is imported and IAT-patchable
  the same way, and phase B masks the d-pad and face buttons while the menu
  is open and leaves sticks, triggers and bumpers to the game. In v1 pads are
  neither watched nor masked.

### Fail-open, in five rules

1. **The gate follows the draw.** The flag may be set only while the
   native runtime has drawn the panel within the last few frames (the
   export bumps a stamp; the d3d11 half checks it before setting the
   flag). A menu that cannot be seen never takes the keyboard. If the
   native runtime is absent, mismatched or not calling the door, the
   menu refuses to open and logs once why.
2. **Every thunk is budgeted.** A fault inside a door drops that door to
   pass-through for the session (the `guardedBudget` pattern), and the menu
   footer and the Status page say "keys shared with the game" from then on.
3. **Idle dismiss, when it is set.** `menu.idle_dismiss` seconds without a
   key or an aim change closes the menu and clears the flag. It SHIPS AT 0
   -- the menu stays up until the summon key or Escape puts it down, which
   is what a settings panel should do (asked for 2026-09-07) -- so this is
   a belt for someone who wants one, not the safeguard. The safeguards
   that always run are the two below: the draw stamp and the two keys.
4. **Escape and the summon key both close it,** and both are read by EDVR's
   own polling, which no door can affect.
5. **`menu.keyboard = shared`** turns the flag off entirely: the doors stay
   installed but pass everything, and the menu runs in Feature 4's original
   watched-keys mode, with the collision check as its safety.

### Why not the alternatives

- **A low-level keyboard hook** (`WH_KEYBOARD_LL`): process-wide, needs a
  message loop thread, is what `hotkey.h` refused for good reason, and
  BELIEVED not to block DirectInput's own reading of the device anyway.
- **A `dinput8.dll` proxy**: a third file in the game folder, a third slot
  to collide with other mods that use that slot as their loader, and it
  only helps if it loads before the game creates its devices. The shared
  table reaches a device that already exists.
- **`SendInput` or pose tricks**: injection, which this project does not
  do (the head-steer design's one exception is gated to a camera mode and
  still unbuilt).

*2026-09-08, the Steam copy:* "the shared table reaches a device that
already exists" is the assumption the DirectInput door rests on, and the
first session on the Steam install put it in question -- the door's
entries pointed into `gameoverlayrenderer64.dll` before the patch, the menu
said "keys private", and Tab boosted the ship. If the overlay hands each
device a private copy of the table, the door sits on our dummy's copy and
the game's device never arrives. The install line now says whose memory
the table lives in (dinput8.dll's own image is the shared one), and a line
prints once when the menu has held the keys a second with no keyboard but
ours having reached the door; the Status page's doors line shows "not
reached yet" for the same condition. `dinput8.dll`'s own keyboard device
is fed by a low-level hook and `GetAsyncKeyState` (its imports say so), so
there is no import of the runtime's to gate below the vtable; if the table
is not shared, the door needs the device the game actually holds, which is
the open question for this module.

## Navigation and interaction

**Keyboard capture update (2026-09-10).** The latest Steam flight
(`edvr_gfx_20260910_171220.log`, build `6AA33721`) confirmed the private-table
failure above: no game keyboard reached the dummy hook during 120 menu frames.
EDVR now intercepts the executable's `DirectInput8Create` import before game
startup, observes the returned factories, and hooks the keyboard devices they
actually return. Each distinct table keeps its own forwarding functions;
Steam's overlay stays in the chain and device identities stay intact. Retained
COM references keep the restore targets alive until shutdown. The shared-table
fallback remains for sessions without an observed factory.
The Steam executable imports both `DINPUT8.dll!DirectInput8Create` and
`d3d11.dll!D3D11CreateDevice` through its normal startup import table, so the
DLL's early capture is installed before the game begins creating input devices.

This path is independent of the VR runtime and applies to both SteamVR and
OpenComposite. `menu.keyboard = private` remains the default. All keyboard
state reads and buffered presses are suppressed while the menu is drawn,
except on **Monitor** and **Status**, which pass keys through and say so in
their footers (adopted Elite keys are inert there, except the next and
previous tab pair, which follows Tab -- see "Your Elite keys" below); the
menu summon key remains reserved on every page;
buffered releases still reach the game, and joystick devices keep their input.
Keys held when the menu closes wait for release before they can act in Elite.
No new configuration is required; installing this change requires a game
restart so the initial DirectInput creation can be captured.

**The footer never fit (MEASURED 2026-09-11).** The 115-character
navigation footer measured 1520 px in a 770 px line at the default
`width_degrees = 30` / `text_degrees = 1.1` (`DrawTextW DT_CALCRECT`,
Segoe UI at the raster's own em; 2518 in 1284 at cap 50, 1107 in 566 at
cap 22 -- the budget is headset-independent at 25.7 em), and it was drawn
`DT_SINGLELINE | DT_END_ELLIPSIS`, so it was cut after about 55
characters: "Tab page", "R twice resets", "Esc close", the pending-restart
count and KEYS SHARED WITH THE GAME had never been visible. The likeliest
root of "how do I change tabs". The footer is now **two lines**, its box
always two lines tall so the panel's height never jumps when a warning
appears, and it is COMPOSED against the raster's ruler
(`menuPanelMeasureLine`, `menuComposeFooter` in `menu_keys.cpp`) rather
than clipped: line 1 is the legend -- `Arrows pick/change  Enter select
Tab page  Esc close` (53 characters, 702 px at cap 30), or with Elite's
keys live `W/S pick  A/D change  Space select  Q/E page  Esc close` (55,
745 px) -- dropping `change`, then `pick`, then `select` where it does
not fit (a 1600 px card at cap 80 keeps `Space select  Q/E page  Esc
close`), and never `page` or `close`. The page item names the adopted
pair on EVERY page and in every keyboard mode (`Q/E page`), because that
pair follows Tab and acts there; the other items follow the live
predicate. Line 2 carries one item by precedence: `KEYS SHARED WITH THE
GAME` (private wanted, gate not private), `keys shared (Monitor)`, `keys
shared (menu.keyboard)  W/S off` (the adopted pick or change pair, never
the page pair), `2 changes at next launch`, or `Tab, arrows and Enter
work too`. Editing reads `Type a value  Backspace deletes  Enter writes
Esc cancels` (752 px at cap 30, `Type a value` dropped first).
The fault line wins in every state, typing included: a stalled draw drops
the gate while a value is typed, and the typing keys are W/A/S/D/Space.
Each footer line is drawn as its own single-line op in its half of the
box (MEASURED 2026-09-11: `DT_END_ELLIPSIS` on a multi-line `DrawTextW`
ellipsises only the LAST line, so one op for both lines clipped line 1 at
the rect's edge with no `...`). The gate is decided BEFORE the content is
built each tick, so the open tick's raster reads the gate the menu will
have (built first, it read the closed menu's 0 and composed the warning
on every open); the warning is tracked like the legend, so it appears and
goes with the gate on a rig with nothing adopted too.
Every string is pinned against real GDI at cap 22, 30, 50 and 80 in
`menu_test`, and the flight instrument is `menu panel: footer line N
measures X px in a Y px line` (four per session), which says
`-- ellipsised` if the measurement above was wrong.

`input_gate_test` exercises independent private factory/device tables, original
call chaining, shared-table joysticks, buffered peek/read semantics, input loss,
held closing keys across all three input paths, restoration and reference
balance. It also creates real ANSI and Unicode DirectInput keyboards through
the test executable's patched import. The flight log now distinguishes a
captured keyboard from evidence that the game has actually called its gate.
These tests do not replace an in-headset confirmation on each VR runtime.

Head-aim and keys coexist; whichever moved last owns the highlight.

**Keys, while the menu is open** (all private to the menu; the "your
Elite key" column is read from your bindings, stock KeyboardMouseOnly
names in brackets):

| Key | your Elite key | Does |
|---|---|---|
| Up / Down | UI_Up / UI_Down (W / S) | move the highlight; hold to repeat (400 ms, then 12 Hz) |
| Left / Right | UI_Left / UI_Right (A / D) | step the highlighted row: toggle, cycle a choice, step a number; hold to repeat; Shift steps a number by ten steps |
| Enter / Space | UI_Select (Space) | activate: flip a switch, next choice, or open a number or string for typing; on an action row, fire it |
| Tab / Shift+Tab | CycleNextPanel / CyclePreviousPanel (E / Q) | next / previous page (the Elite keys do not repeat when held, and they work on Monitor and Status too, exactly as Tab does there) |
| PageUp / PageDown | CyclePreviousPage / CycleNextPage (Z / C) | read on through the explanation beside the row, three lines at a time; changes the page when there is nothing to scroll |
| Home / End | -- | first / last row |
| R | -- | reset the highlighted row to its shipped default (a confirm on the row, then R again) |
| Escape, the summon key | UI_Back (Backspace) | close (fade out, keys released); Escape first abandons a value being typed; UI_Back never cancels an edit |
| the summon key with Shift | -- | recentre: re-anchor the panel where you are looking now |

**Your Elite keys (2026-09-11).** The ten elements that walk Elite's own
cockpit panels -- `UI_Up`, `UI_Down`, `UI_Left`, `UI_Right`, `UI_Select`,
`UI_Back`, `CycleNextPanel`, `CyclePreviousPanel`, `CycleNextPage`,
`CyclePreviousPage` -- are read from the player's `.binds` (both slots of
each, `eliteBindsLookupSlots`, the same newest-maintained-file rule as the
camera keys) and become ALIASES of the actions in the table above: the
same dispatcher (`dispatchNav` in `menu.cpp`), never a second one, and
never a `Hotkey` binding (the registry holds sixteen and the d3d11 half
already fills up to twelve). The rules, applied per slot in table order
(`menuAliasResolve`, `menu_keys.h`), each with the reason it records for
the log: R9 a gamepad or mouse slot is never adopted; R8 a keyboard key
this build cannot name is reported with Elite's spelling; R6 a chorded
slot is refused (the poll is a bare vk; MEASURED: no UI_*/Cycle* keyboard
slot in the thirty stock schemes or in Sean's file carries a `<Modifier>`,
and the parser bounds each slot's Modifier by the next slot's tag, where
the camera parser deliberately scans to the element's end); R4 Shift is
the menu's own modifier; R3 the summon key, or a Ctrl/Alt that is half of
its chord, would close what it opens; R1 a key with the SAME meaning as a
fixed key (stock UI_Select = Space) is left to the fixed key but still
names the legend; R2 a key with ANOTHER meaning (stock CycleNextPanel =
End, CycleNextPage = Home) keeps its documented one; R5 a registered EDVR
hotkey is polled whether or not the menu is open; R7 first in table order
wins a duplicate. A modifier used as a plain key is admitted (Sean's
`UI_Back = Key_LeftControl`: Ctrl alone closes the menu; it reaches the
game only after a release and a fresh press, through the gate's release
tail). The invariant `menu_test` pins: every adopted vk is unique and none
is a fixed key, Escape, the summon key or a registered hotkey.

**When they act -- one predicate.** An adopted key acts only when
`menuAliasMayAct(inputGateHoldsGameKeyboard(), editing, statusPage)` is
true: the gate PROVABLY holds the game's keyboard (the flag AND a live
DirectInput door AND the game seen reaching it -- `inputGatePrivate()`
reports the flag alone, which a retired door does not clear, and on a rig
whose game device dispatches through a table the door is not on the flag
is set while every key still reaches the ship), not while a value is
typed, not on Monitor or Status. Everywhere the predicate is false an
adopted key IS a game key: on a shared page one press of E would cycle
the ship's panel AND the menu's page. So they are inert on the shared
pages, under `menu.keyboard = shared`, on the first tick after open (the
flag is set at the end of the tick), while the draw is stale, on a
retired door, on a rig where the game's keyboard has never been seen
reaching a door (the "Tab boosts" case above; the Status row reads `held
back (see log)` and the log says so once), and while typing (W, A, S, D,
Q, E, Z, C, Space and Backspace are typing keys). The fixed keys keep
their documented shared behaviour on those pages, and `input_gate.cpp`
gains no swallow and no injection. MEASURED on Sean's rig 2026-09-11: the
"reached" evidence arrives in the same millisecond as the first open.
The legend follows the same predicate, never mere adoption, so it never
names a dead key -- one extra raster on the tick after open.

**The one exception: the page pair follows Tab (2026-09-11, after the
first flight).** Sean, from the headset: Monitor and Status let keys fall
through, so Q/E did nothing on exactly the pages a player wants to leave.
The next and previous tab aliases (`kNavPageNext`, `kNavPagePrev`;
`menuAliasFollowsTab`, `menuAliasMayActNav` in `menu_keys.h`) now act
wherever Tab acts: on Monitor and Status, under `menu.keyboard = shared`,
and on a rig whose game keyboard never reached a door -- and there they
reach the ship as well, exactly as Tab does there (BELIEVED harmless:
CycleNextPanel/CyclePreviousPanel move between the tabs of a focused
cockpit panel and do nothing with no panel up; check by pressing E on
Monitor with a panel open and closed). Only typing holds them, since the
arrows and Tab are the editor's then. Every other alias keeps the strict
predicate: pick, change, select and back on a shared page would move a
row and the ship at once. The legend names the adopted page pair on every
page for the same reason; the Status row reads `page keys only (keys
shared)` or `page keys only; rest held back (see log)` where the rest is
off. Tested in `menu_test` (`testAliasMayAct`, the status-page and
shared-mode footers).

**Swallow until release.** Every key -- fixed, typing and alias -- goes
through one tracker (`keyRepeatStep`): stepped with `act=false` it is
tracked and PARKED until released, so a key held across a state change
never fires when the state later allows it, neither the edge nor the
repeat train. Two primes: at `openMenu` every tracker is seeded from the
raw key (a W held for thrust when F8 opens the menu moves nothing until
released; this changes the fixed keys too -- a Down held through the
summon no longer fires once and repeats), and at `beginEdit` every typing
key is (a letter held when a Number row opens cannot land in the buffer
it opened; also the Space-appended-at-open case commitEdit's trim only
papered over). While typing the aliases are stepped `act=false`; outside
an edit the typing keys are stepped against their REAL state `act=false`
(the old poll passed focused=false, which forced every tracker up each
tick and tracked nothing -- the opposite of what its comment said).
Fixes -> Monitor by a held E: fired in frame N, gate shared at the end of
N, E captured into the release tail; edge-only, so the held E fires no
second time on Monitor even though it acts there. Monitor -> Fixes by Tab
with W held: W was parked, nothing until release. Page keys are edge-only
(BELIEVED: Elite's own tab key does not repeat).

**Left out, and why.** `UI_Toggle` (stock `=`): its in-game meaning is
not measured (BELIEVED: "UI Nested Toggle", expands a nested list item;
check the label in Options > Controls > Interface Mode); the only
plausible menu meaning is already UI_Select. `UIFocus` (Sean:
Key_LeftShift, a hold modifier) -- Shift is the menu's own. `FocusLeftPanel
/ Comms / Radar / RightPanel` (1/2/3/4) and `QuickCommsPanel` (Enter) would
be new navigation, the digits are typing keys and Enter is fixed.
`UI_Back` closes the menu on the BELIEF that it backs out of a cockpit
panel in Elite; if it does not, drop it from `kMenuUiElements`.

**Re-read, and the gaps.** The keys follow `device_hook`'s bindings
fingerprint: a rebind applied in Elite is re-read within two 5 s checks
and logged as `menu keys: your Elite bindings changed -- ...` or `... read
the same as before` (silence there is indistinguishable from a dead
mechanism). `hotkey.read_game_bindings = 0` drops them (the same switch as
the camera keys); the live flip is handled in `menuConfigure`, because an
unchanged fingerprint would never re-read. A `hotkey.menu` change
re-resolves the cached slots without a file read. BELIEVED: a player on a
stock preset has NO `.binds` under `Options\Bindings` (Elite writes
`Custom.*.binds` only after a rebind; Sean's directory holds only Custom
files), so the confused majority gets `menu keys: no bindings files were
found` and only the footer fix helps them -- the
`ControlSchemes\<preset>.binds` fallback is the follow-up. BELIEVED:
Elite's `Key_` names are DirectInput scan-code names while
`virtualKeyFromName` maps letters by VK, so on AZERTY/Dvorak the adopted
`W` could be a different physical key from the one Elite acts on (the
camera keys carry the same belief). The log's arc: `edvr_log.py --grep
"menu keys:"`; exactly one outcome line per session, from an
unconditional call after the camera keys' adoption, so a log with none
means the call never ran.

**Not folded in, recorded here.** The pre-existing arrow /
VanityCameraScroll overlap: `device_hook`'s game-mirrored watchers poll
their keys while the menu is private, so an arrow bound to the view cycle
counts a press the game never saw. And `inputGatePrivate()`'s blind spot
for the FIXED keys on a retired door: they keep acting on the flag alone,
as before; only the adopted keys ask the stricter question.

**Head-aim.** The head ray (from `headPose()`, the raw pose the native
runtime publishes every frame) is intersected with the panel in its
anchor frame; the row under it highlights, with hitboxes one full row
pitch tall and a hysteresis before the highlight moves, so a resting
head never flickers it.
After a key press head-aim is parked until the ray leaves the highlighted
row's hitbox by more than one row. `menu.aim = keys | head | both`.
**Flown 2026-09-07: `both` fought the keys** -- a head that drifts back to
the row it was reading re-selects it under a hand that just moved away --
so the default is `keys`, and head-aim is an opt-in for a player who wants
it (gate G6's numbers would tune `both`, and are still unmeasured).

**Dwell-to-select** is off by default and stays a phase C item: it needs
an aim ray steadier than a head, which means the eye tracker, and
`docs/eye-tracking.md` records that no field driver publishes a usable one
today.

**Typing a value** (BUILT 2026-09-07, the gate's whole point): Enter on a
number or string row opens it for typing. The digits, the letters, the
numeric pad, `.` `-` `,` space and Backspace edit the buffer -- and
nothing else, so a stray key cannot corrupt a value; Enter writes it,
Escape leaves it alone, and moving off the row abandons it. A number is
checked before it is written: one that does not parse, or falls outside
the row's own range, is refused with the range named on the Status page's
last-write line rather than written and clamped silently. While a row is
being typed the arrows and Tab belong to the editor, no adopted Elite key
acts (they are typing keys), and head-aim is parked, so a look that
wanders cannot take the row away mid-value.
Typing is what the keyboard gate makes possible and Feature 4 could not
offer.

**Anything with two states is a switch.** A `Toggle` row draws the
installer's control where its value would be -- an accent track with the
knob at the end the value is at -- and so does a two-way CHOICE where one
side is "leave the game alone", by the installer's own rule
(`twoChoiceToggle` in `settings_view.cpp`): exactly two choices, one of
them `off` or `stock`. That is most of the fixes, and they read as
switches now rather than as words to cycle. Where the value written is
not literally `on`/`off` -- one that writes `steady` against `stock` --
the word stays beside the switch, because the switch alone cannot say
it; where it is, the word goes. A row with a pending restart change keeps
its text (`off -> on`), because a switch cannot show two values at once.

**The tooltip is a card of its own, BESIDE the panel.** The highlighted
row gets what `edvr.ini` says about that key. **The facts come first** --
the range or the list of choices, the shipped value, whether the change
applies at once or waits for a launch, and the key that acts on it --
and the ini's own comment block follows. That order is deliberate: the
buffer holds about a thousand characters and forty-six of the comment
blocks are longer than that (the longest is three and a half thousand),
so something is cut on those rows, and what is cut must be prose and
never a fact. The generator carries the full comment block into the row
table as `detail` for this.

It appears only after `menu.tooltip_delay` seconds resting on one row
(1.5 by default, 0 for never): an explanation is for someone who has
stopped, not something to flick past. It is set in a face smaller than
the rows, and its card is sized to the MEASURED height of its text --
`DT_CALCRECT` with the same font and the same wrap the draw will use,
not a character count -- capped by the panel's own height. A rule joins
it to the row it belongs to. Resting the look on the card counts as
using the menu, so an idle dismiss set by hand cannot close the panel
mid-sentence.

**What does not fit is scrolled to, not lost.** PageUp and PageDown move
the body three lines at a time, with a thumb on the card's edge showing
how much there is and where in it you are. The raster measures the text
and publishes how far it can still go (`menuPanelPopupScrollMax`), and
the model clamps its counter to that, so the scroll cannot run off the
end of a text only the raster has measured. Those two keys fall back to
changing the page when there is nothing to scroll; Tab is what changes
the page deliberately.

**How it sits beside the panel without moving it.** The rasterised bitmap
is WIDER than the menu card -- the card, a gap, and the tooltip's strip,
the last two a fixed fraction of the card (`kTipGapFrac` and
`kTipWidthFrac`, in `menu_panel.h` because both the model and the raster
must read the same numbers) -- and the strip is transparent whenever no
tooltip is up. Because the strip is always allocated, the panel's size in
the world never changes as a tooltip comes and goes, or between pages.

The bitmap is then **slid along its own surface** by `panelShift()`, so
that the CARD's middle lands on the anchor's forward rather than the
bitmap's. One value reaches the shader, the hit test and the culling box,
and the card comes out exactly as it was before the strip existed: the
same width, the same distance, square to the look.

Two things were got wrong on the way here and are worth keeping written
down. The first build **turned the anchor** instead. That put the card's
middle in the right direction but left it facing the old one, so the card
was seen nine degrees oblique, its left edge 1.50 m away and its right
1.41 m; and being latched at summon, it went stale the moment the ini was
edited with the panel up. The second mistake was scaling the panel's
angle by the strip's ratio: the bitmap maps linearly onto the surface and
the tangent does not, so the card came out 3.6% wider than
`width_degrees` asked, and 9% at the widest setting. Both are why
`panelHalfW()` works in metres and `panelShift()` is recomputed every
frame.

The head-aim hit test works in the bitmap's own coordinates and
`menuPanelLineAt` rejects any point in the strip, so a look parked on the
tooltip selects nothing rather than the row at that height. The toast and
the fps overlay share the raster and get no strip and no shift.

With the strip, the panel reaches `atan(2.14 * tan(w/2))` to the right --
29.8 degrees at the default width. Past about 35 the strip leaves one
eye's frustum on most headsets and the card would be seen by one eye
only, which is the worst thing to do to text somebody has stopped to
read, so `menu.width_degrees` is held to 36 while tooltips are on and the
log says once that it was.

The very first build drew the card over the rows, and it hid the values
it was explaining (flown 2026-09-07).

**Pads** (phase B): d-pad navigates and steps, A activates, B closes,
bumpers change page, watched through `xinput_watch` and masked from the
game through door 4.

## What it shows

Pages, in tab order. Each row is: label, then its value as a switch, a
number, a choice or a typed string, and where it applies, the restart
badge. The ini's own explanation is in the tooltip beside the row.

**The tab strip scrolls.** It shows the window of pages that fits the
panel's width, always including the current one, with a `<` or `>` at
whichever end has more. Developer mode adds four pages and the strip ran
off the edge -- the pages past it could not be seen, and nothing said
they were there (flown 2026-09-07).

1. **Performance.** The rows tagged `menu performance` in `edvr.ini`, in
   the ini's own order:
   `temporal_aa`, `temporal_aa_model` (labelled **DLSS preset**, default K),
   `render_sharpness`, `foveation`, `settlement_detail`,
   `ui_quality` (labelled **UI quality**, off / 100% / 125%, default off:
   the interface panels' size and the UI layer, one row), and `render_scale`
   when its branch lands. Costs where they are measured:
   the temporal pass's own timing, NVIDIA's pass per eye, the sharpen's
   timestamp pair, the pixel fraction under scale. UI/smoke depth and
   station motion follow the AA mode automatically.
   **DLSS preset** sits right under **Anti-aliasing** and stays on the page
   under every mode; it dims and stops responding to Left/Right or Enter
   whenever `temporal_aa` is not `dlss` or `dlaa` (the only two modes that
   read it), rather than dropping out of the row list, which had read as
   the setting vanishing on a mode change.
   At the BOTTOM of the page, a **Developer mode** switch (`menu.developer`,
   its `ui:` line tagged `menu performance`), so the extra pages can be
   turned on from inside the headset; flipping it rebuilds the pages, and
   the page being read keeps its highlight and scroll through the rebuild
   rather than jumping back to the first row under the hand that had
   just reached the last one.
2. **Fixes.** Every other `[fix]` row tagged `menu`, under the ini's own
   headings ("When the eyes disagree", ...), scrolling. Restart rows are
   shown, badged, and editable: the badge is the point of showing them.
3. **Monitor.** fpsVR's readout, gathered as cheaply as it can be, and
   where each number comes from:
   - frame rate, frame time, the 1% low (the 99th-percentile frame time)
     and the max, over the last ten seconds, from EDVR's own
     Present-to-Present clock, ringed every frame;
   - the app's GPU time, the CPU frame interval and dropped frames (the
     last ten seconds and since launch), from **the native OpenXR timing
     source** -- read once a frame at the render-to-submit boundary and
     published on the channel; `advanced.app_gpu_timing = on` by default
     gates the read;
   - the display's rate and frame budget, and the eye size;
   - CPU load (system and Elite's share), RAM, VRAM through
     `IDXGIAdapter3::QueryVideoMemoryInfo`, and GPU load and temperature
     through NvAPI where an NVIDIA driver is present (elsewhere "n/a" --
     fpsVR's AMD path is a vendor library this project does not carry);
   - EDVR's own passes' measured cost, from the totals they already keep;
   - **two frame-time strips**, fpsVR's pair: the GPU frame and the
     render thread's busy time, each the last 120 frames against its own
     budget line, green within it, amber over it, red at twice it. A
     frame over budget on the GPU strip is a different problem from one
     over budget on the CPU strip, which is why they are drawn apart; a
     frame whose compositor record has not settled is a gap in the GPU
     strip rather than a zero-height bar.
   **GPU TIME and CPU TIME are fpsVR's two frametimes.** GPU TIME is the
   compositor's own GPU frame total -- its record's "time between work
   submitted immediately after present until the end of compositor
   submitted work", which is the timeline fpsVR's author describes as the
   scene, the companion window and the distortion pass. CPU TIME is
   EDVR's own measurement, not the compositor's: the Present-to-Present
   period less the time the game's thread spent blocked inside
   WaitGetPoses and inside Present, which is the render thread's busy
   time -- a LARGER window than the compositor's, by the work the game
   does after its second submit, and the more useful of the two when a
   frame is CPU bound. APP GPU carries the scene's own GPU work, which
   the record reports directly. The Present period sits on the FRAME RATE
   tile; frame rate, the 1% low and the strips stay on the period, as
   fpsVR's do.
   Both tiles are the **mean over about 200 milliseconds**, fpsVR's own
   update window, with the ten-second mean on the sub-line.

   **THE RECORD IS NOT THE STRUCT IN openvr.h, AND ITS SIZE FIELD DOES
   NOT SAY SO.** This cost four flights and two wrong answers, so it is
   written down in full.

   Elite ships an `openvr_api.dll` that exports `IVRCompositor_014`,
   which is OpenVR **v0.9.20**. SteamVR fills the `Compositor_FrameTiming`
   belonging to the interface a process BOUND, not the size the caller
   asked for: we passed 184, it echoed 184 back untouched, and it filled
   the 176-byte v0.9.20 record. Decoding that with the modern struct
   displaced eleven fields. What the Monitor page was actually showing:

   | Tile | Read from | Which is really |
   |---|---|---|
   | GPU TIME | byte 40 | `m_flCompositorIdleCpuMs` |
   | APP GPU | bytes 32+36 | the compositor's own GPU and CPU |
   | DROPPED | byte 16 | the low half of the record's clock |
   | REPROJECTED | byte 20 | the high half of the record's clock |

   The clock is what proved it. Read bytes 16 to 23 as one double and
   they are a plausible uptime that advances by one frame period per
   frame index, and by exactly the wall-clock seconds between two
   probes. Nothing else fits.

   So the reader now **measures which layout it is being given** and
   never asks the size field. The test is that clock: only one candidate
   offset holds a value that is a plausible uptime AND advances like a
   frame clock, and the pose confirms it, since an `HmdMatrix34_t` whose
   rows are unit vectors sits at byte 84 in one layout and 96 in the
   other. Both must agree before the reader arms, and it says in the log
   which layout it found and why.

   The real field map, v0.9.20: dropped frames at **12**, the clock at
   **16**, the scene's GPU work at **24**, the GPU frame at **28**, the
   compositor's GPU at 32 and CPU at 36, its idle at 40, the WaitGetPoses
   / poses-ready / frame-ready stamps at 60, 64 and 68, the pose at 84,
   and the reprojection flags LAST at **168**.

   **GPU TIME** is `m_flTotalRenderGpuMs` (byte 28), which is Valve's own
   worked example on the `Compositor_FrameTiming` page and what fpsVR
   shows: 9.51 ms mean across the six probe samples against fpsVR's
   steady 9.6. **CPU TIME** is that page's other example,
   `m_flNewFrameReadyMs - m_flNewPosesReadyMs + m_flCompositorRenderCpuMs`
   (2.47 ms mean), with EDVR's own render-thread figure (3.67 ms) beside
   it; the 1.20 ms between them is entirely the tail from the second
   submit to the next WaitGetPoses call, which fpsVR's window excludes
   and ours includes.

   Two claims from the misdecode are now retracted, in case they are
   remembered: "Elite calls WaitGetPoses thirty microseconds before it
   submits" was `compositorRenderStart - compositorUpdateEnd`, two
   adjacent compositor stamps. It really calls it 7.2 ms before the
   vsync, gets poses 0.2 ms after it, and submits 2.6 ms after that. And
   "the app's GPU time reads 0.2 ms" was the compositor's own GPU plus
   CPU time.

   **The record read is the settled one, two compositor frames back**;
   with the most recent one (`framesAgo = 0`) the GPU fields have not
   resolved at the WaitGetPoses boundary. The monitor writes it into the
   ring entry of the frame it describes, two back, so drops and EDVR's
   events line up. Twice a session (20 s and 60 s after arming, three
   frames each) the openvr half logs the four most recent records field
   by field, and then the newest record's RAW WORDS in hex. That hex is
   what identified the layout; keep it, because it is the only thing that
   can be read off any flight's log without another build.
   Laid out as **sixteen tiles, four across** -- a caption, one big
   number, one small line each -- after the first flight found rows of
   sentences full of numbers unreadable in a headset; the last drop and
   EDVR's events in it are the one line under the tiles. The second
   flight found the big number clipped and the sub-lines running off
   the tiles: a four-across tile is about seven degrees wide, sixteen
   characters of a small face, and the number's box had been sized to
   its cap height rather than its line box. Now every box is sized to
   its font's line height, the sub-line wraps over two lines in a
   smaller face, and no sub-line is longer than about thirty characters.
   Its cost, by construction: the ring is one clock read and a store per
   frame; the compositor read is one small copy per frame; the load and
   memory samplers run once a second and ONLY while the page is showing;
   the page re-rasterises at 4 Hz on the worker thread. Frame time lives
   here now and not on Status.
4. **Status.** Read-only, the README's "checking it worked" as a live
   panel, and the page a support thread will ask for: EDVR's version and
   the game build; the native OpenXR runtime's name, read from the
   runtime's own instance properties; eye
   texture size and tangents; guard stage; temporal mode and whether
   NVIDIA's library loaded; the gate's state (which doors are armed, which
   the game has reached, keys private or shared); the **Elite keys** row
   (`W/S A/D Space Q/E Z/C L-Ctrl` -- the adopted keys by group -- or why
   there are none: `none adopted (see log)`, `no bindings files found`,
   `off (read_game_bindings)`, `not read yet`, `off while keys are shared`,
   or `held back (see log)` when adopted but the game's keyboard has not
   been seen reaching a door; the back key is named here and in the log,
   never on the footer); this panel's own price
   (bitmap size, raster time, the composite's measured GPU time per eye);
   the list of changes waiting for a restart; and the result of the last
   ini write.

**Diagnosing drops caused by the mod** (built 2026-09-07 the same night,
after the question was asked). A drop count says drops happened, not why,
and the mod's own one-off work is the class that would explain one: a
shader compile at first engage, a withhold, a reload parsing the ini on
the render thread, the menu's own write. So every frame's ring entry now
carries what EDVR did in it and what it cost, and the page and the log
read the two together:

- **Events**, ORed into the frame from wherever they happen, both halves
  (`PerfEvent` in `perf_monitor.h`, the native runtime's crossing on the
  channel): a reload with its duration, an ini write, a shader compile
  with its duration (every `shaderSwapCompile*`), NVIDIA's feature
  creation with its duration, a withhold, a resubmit, a census request, a
  bitmap upload, a bindings re-read, the menu opening or closing.
- **EDVR's CPU time**, measured: the frame boundary's body (a clock around
  `hookedPresent`'s frame work), the door's passes per eye (a clock around
  the lambdas in `hookedSubmit`, crossing on the channel), and the draw
  hooks on one frame in sixteen -- the four draw thunks clock themselves
  and the real call they forward, and the difference is EDVR's own cost in
  the hook. Two clock reads per draw on a sample frame, one branch on the
  other fifteen.
- **EDVR's GPU time at the door**: a timestamp pair per eye around every
  pass the door runs (`edvrDoorGpuBegin` / `End`, exports the native runtime
  calls), never awaited, polled on later calls. This is the mod's whole
  submit-side GPU price in one number, beside the compositor's app GPU
  figure. What it does not cover: the ui_depth second draws and the
  theater's draw-path work, which happen inside the game's frame.
- **The page**: "Dropped frames" now ends with how many of the window's
  drops coincided with EDVR activity, naming the events, against how many
  were clean; "Last drop" shows the most recent drop or long frame with
  its interval and EDVR's events in it; "EDVR CPU" and "EDVR GPU" show the
  measured per-frame figures.
- **The log**: a `monitor: DROPPED FRAME` (or `LONG FRAME`, for one over
  twice the budget by EDVR's own clock when the compositor reports no
  drop) line with the interval, the compositor's record for the frame
  (GPU app and compositor, the app's busy time, when the poses came and
  when the submit landed, from the vsync), EDVR's four costs and its
  events, at most one every five seconds and sixty a session -- so a
  field report carries the attribution without the headset on.
- **The frame the record describes.** The compositor's record is read
  two frames back (the settled one, above), and it is written into the
  ring entry of THAT frame, beside the events EDVR raised in it. The
  first build wrote it into the newest entry, so a drop was blamed on
  whatever EDVR did two frames after it -- and with the Monitor page up,
  that was its own bitmap upload four times a second, which is why the
  "with EDVR" count climbed steadily on the second flight (2026-09-07)
  while every logged drop said "EDVR events: none".
- **And the hitch removed**: the menu's ini write (read, merge, write,
  replace, mirror copy, backup copy) ran on the render thread in the first
  build; it now runs on a worker, serialised and coalesced while a key is
  held, and the frame thread only enqueues, shows the value, and drains
  the results.

What this cannot do is name a cause the ring does not carry. A drop with
no EDVR event and ordinary EDVR costs is the game's or the runtime's, and
the page says so by calling it clean.

**The overlay** (`menu.fps_overlay`, off by default, and **a switch on
the Performance page** since 2026-09-08 -- it is the one thing a player
wants to turn on from inside the headset, and until then it was reachable
only by editing the file): a single-line readout with frames per second over
the last second, then concise GPU and CPU labels averaged over 0.2 seconds.
Native OpenXR uses application GPU segments and producer-thread CPU wall
intervals, excluding known runtime and transfer waits. Missing measurements
show `--`.
The fixed reference raster preserves apparent size across eye resolutions,
and `menu.text_degrees` controls its angular text size. See the
[layout checks](performance-overlay-sizing-2026-09-15.md) and
[benchmark method](native-render-benchmark-2026-09-15.md).
It is shown while the
menu is CLOSED and pinned to the head, the toolkit's overlay, because that
is what was asked for and a gauge you carry has its uses. `fps_overlay_yaw`
and `fps_overlay_pitch` put it where you can stop seeing it (default 20
degrees above the look). `menu.fps_overlay_lock` keeps the readout visible
while the F8 menu is open, drawing it at the top of the menu panel so you
can watch FPS while changing settings for A/B tests; it is off by default,
so the readout clears while the menu is open as before. The lock has no lag:
the door builds its anchor from each frame's own pose (`setMenuHeadLock` on
the channel) rather than from a value published a frame earlier. Its price
is the panel's: one region copy plus a composite over the readout's own
pixel box per eye per frame, timed by a timestamp pair and printed in the
graphics log after 240 frames (`menu panel: measured ... ms per eye`), so
the number is measured and not believed.

With `menu.developer = on`, three more pages and two changes everywhere:
the ini's dotted key name appears under each label, and each row's hint
gains the "live" or "restart" word the generator derived.

4. **Advanced** and 5. **Experimental.** Every key the build reads from
   those sections, automatically: `getBool` reads are toggles, `getInt` /
   `getFloat` (and their `InRange` forms) are numbers with the declared
   bounds, and `getString` reads are typed unless the key carries choices.
   A developer key gets its choices from a `# dev: choices a, b, c` line,
   or from a full `# ui:` line where it has one.
   **A `ui:` line is allowed outside `[fix]`** (`UI_SECTIONS` in the
   generator). It buys the key its LABEL and its CHOICES in this menu and
   nothing else: the installer's window still shows only `[fix]`
   (`EXPOSED_SECTIONS`), and for a developer key the page and tier still
   come from its section. Only `[fix]` and `[menu]` keys may carry a
   `| menu` token and be ordinary rows (`MENU_ROW_SECTIONS`); the
   generator refuses the token anywhere else, because everywhere else the
   section already decides the page. The point is that demoting a setting out of `[fix]` costs it
   its tier and its page but not the words somebody already wrote for it.
   Foveated shading was demoted that way on 2026-09-08 -- it ships off,
   and what it saves does not move the frame rate on Elite -- and kept
   both its label and its four presets. A key may carry a `ui:` line or a
   `dev:` line, never both.
   Instruments that write files or scan memory are still one toggle away,
   which is why the tier exists and is off by default.
6. **Instruments.** Action rows for the things that today need a hotkey
   bound: dump the camera history (the `PAUSE` key's job), take a draw
   census with the quad probe, reload `edvr.ini` now, write a marker line
   to both logs, and reset Explorer Cam's counted view to zero (the planned
   camera-index reset, which has needed a key of its own and gets a row
   instead). Each fires the same function its hotkey fires.

**Toasts.** When a live setting changes -- from the menu, the installer's
window, or a hand edit -- one line fades through the view for a couple of
seconds: `sharpening 0.30 -- 0.19 ms`, or `vr_handover = early -- takes
effect at the next launch`. Not head-locked: a toast spawns where you are
looking at that moment, low in the view, and stays there while it fades.
With the menu open, toasts are unnecessary (the row itself updates) and are
suppressed. `menu.toasts = off` for players who want nothing uncommanded
on screen, ever; the menu itself never appears uncommanded.

## Restart flagging

Sean's addition, made a first-class mechanism rather than a badge:

- **Derived, not declared twice.** `tools/gen_settings_schema.py` already
  reads "live" or "restart" out of each setting's prose, or from `| live`
  / `| restart` on the `ui:` line (`when_it_applies()`). The menu's table
  is generated from the same pass, so a row can never say something the
  ini does not.
- **Enforced at build time.** Today the generator already fails the build
  when a `[fix]` setting shown in the desktop window says neither word
  (`gen_settings_schema.py`, "do not say when they take effect"), and
  every `[fix]` row the menu shows is one of those. For the developer tier
  -- the `[advanced]` and `[experimental]` keys, which were never checked
  -- the generator prints a WARNING naming each key that does not say, and
  the row wears a `?` badge with "when it applies is not documented" in
  its hint, so an unknown is never silently read as live. (As built: 61
  such keys on 2026-09-07; the error form waits until their comments are
  written, which is a separate change.) A restart row that reads as live
  is the failure this exists to prevent.
- **Shown three ways.** The row wears a `restart` badge always. After a
  change it shows the running value and the pending one (`stock -> early
  at next launch`). The panel footer counts them on its second line
  (`2 changes at next launch`; since 2026-09-11 the count yields to a
  keys-shared warning, which is shown nowhere else), and the Status page
  lists them by name and remains the complete list.
- **Known, not guessed.** At its first parse the d3d11 half snapshots the
  values of every restart key (the generated table says which). Any later
  parse -- a menu write, a hand edit, the installer -- diffs against that
  snapshot; a difference is a pending change. This also gives the config
  audit a line it has always lacked: `edvr.ini: <advanced key>
  changed on disk but is read at launch; the running value is still on`.
  That line ships with this work whether or not the menu is open.

## Placement and rendering

**Anchor.** On summon, the d3d11 half reads the current raw head pose
(`headPose()`, published by the native runtime before any EDVR offset touches
it), takes its look direction's yaw and pitch and builds the anchor from
those with **no roll** -- upright in the world, so the panel's edges are
level whatever tilt the head had at the summon (the first build latched
the whole pose, roll included, and a head cocked at F8 got a cocked menu;
flown 2026-09-07) -- and publishes it on the channel; the panel sits
`menu.distance` metres (default 1.4) along the anchor's forward, upright
in the anchor frame, and does not move until recentred or re-summoned. At
the door, the native runtime computes the per-eye transform exactly as
`theaterXform` does -- current-head vectors into anchor space, then the
eye's ray origin with the eye's real lateral offset from
`GetEyeToHeadTransform` rather than the theater's constant -- and hands it
to the export. Unlike the theater, the game is fed the LIVE pose
throughout, so the compositor's reprojection is correct for the panel and
the frame alike; nothing here needs the theater's world-lock reasoning
because nothing here lies to the runtime. Under the retired `pose_hold` or
`shimmer_rest`, whatever pose the submit carries is the pose the export is
given (gate G7).

**Where at the door.** Last, as [anti-aliasing.md](anti-aliasing.md)'s
"order at the door" already reserves: after the temporal pass, the crop,
the scale and the sharpen, onto the native-size outgoing frame. If that
frame is already an EDVR texture (any of those passes ran) the panel is
drawn straight onto it, zero extra copies. If it is the game's own texture
the door first takes the per-eye copy the resubmit shadow already knows how
to make, draws on the copy, and submits that. The game's textures are never
drawn on.

**The draw** (as built): a compute pass in the FSS theater's shape rather
than a quad -- per output pixel, the view ray from the published tangents
is rotated into the anchor's frame and intersected with the panel, flat or
on a cylinder (curve `menu.curve`, default 0.2), and the bitmap is blended
over the frame's pixel. The eye's region is copied into an EDVR-owned
texture and the dispatch covers only the panel's projected bounding box
(nine points along its top and bottom edges, so a curved panel's bulge is
inside it); a panel entirely outside an eye costs that eye nothing at all.
No depth: the panel draws over the cockpit like the game's own HUD does. A
150 ms fade in and out is the only animation. The shader is embedded HLSL,
compiled on first use.

**Type in degrees.** Cap height `menu.text_degrees` (default 1.1, gate G5
measures it), row pitch twice that, the panel about 24 by 18 degrees. The
bitmap is sized per headset from the eye size and tangents the channel
already carries, at the headset's own pixels per degree at the panel, so
it composites near 1:1 and is native-crisp whatever `render_scale` says.

**Rasterisation.** GDI into a 32-bit DIB section: `CreateFontW` /
`DrawTextW` with `ANTIALIASED_QUALITY`, white on black, luminance taken as
alpha -- the installer's own text path (`src/installer/ui.cpp`), and the
game already imports GDI32, so nothing new enters the process. Redrawn on
**change only**, on a worker thread, into the back half of a double-buffered
texture that the frame thread swaps in; per frame the panel costs one draw
per eye and nothing on the CPU. DirectWrite would give better glyph shapes
and a build-time SDF atlas would remove the font engine entirely; both are
noted as the upgrade if GDI's output disappoints at 1.1 degrees (gate G4),
and neither is needed to start.

## Persistence

The menu writes `edvr.ini` and nothing else; the running configuration
changes because the file did.

- **The installer's own edit.** `iniedit.cpp` moved from `src/installer`
  to `src/common` (it already followed `config.cpp`'s grammar exactly and
  had no installer dependencies; it now lives in the plain `edvr`
  namespace, which the installer's own namespace finds unqualified); the
  d3d11 half uses `mergeIni(source, source, &source, {{dotted, value}})`
  for one value, exactly as `SettingsModel::set` does -- the line where
  the key already lives, uncommented if it was an expert default, every
  comment untouched.
- **Re-read before write**, the installer's 2026-08-28 lesson: the file on
  disk is the source, never a cached copy.
- **Atomic write**: temp file beside the ini, then `MoveFileExW` with
  replace-and-write-through, so `config.cpp`'s size check never meets half
  a save and an editor holding the file mid-save cannot lose the write.
- **Apply now**: `Config::get().reloadIfChanged()` is called immediately
  after the write, so the change lands on this frame instead of the next
  poll, and through the same configure path a hand edit takes -- no module
  learns anything new.
- **Backup once per session** before the first change, to
  `edvr_backup\menu-<stamp>\edvr.ini`, the settings window's rule.
- **Mirror.** After each write the ini is copied to the installer's mirror
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\EDVR\<leaf>-<store>\`), so a game update that wipes the
  folder cannot lose an evening's tuning; `mirrorDirFor`'s naming rule
  moves to common with `iniedit` so the DLL and the installer cannot
  disagree about the folder.
- **Log line per change**: `menu: fix.render_sharpness 0.0 -> 0.3 (written;
  live)` or `(written; takes effect at the next launch)`.

The installer's settings window and the menu can never disagree, because
neither owns any state the other lacks; the desktop window remains the
place for everything, the menu the flight-relevant subset plus, for
developers, the rest.

## Safeguards, gathered

It never appears uncommanded (toasts excepted, and they have an off
switch). It never takes the keyboard unless it is being drawn. It draws
only onto EDVR's own copies. A rasterisation or draw failure means no menu
and one log line, with the game unaffected. A door fault means keys shared
and the panel says so. Closed, it costs one key poll and one byte
comparison per DirectInput call; open, it says its own price on the Status
page.

## Settings sketch

```
[hotkey]
# Summon and dismiss the settings menu. Private to EDVR: the game never
# sees this key while it is bound here. Checked against your own Elite
# bindings at launch and on every rebind; a clash is named in the log and
# on the panel. Live.
menu = F8

[menu]
# While the menu is open the game sees no keyboard at all (private), or
# every key reaches the game as well and the menu only watches (shared).
# Live.
keyboard = private

# How the highlighted row is chosen: the arrow keys (keys), where your
# head points (head), or whichever moved last (both). Live.
aim = keys

# The head-locked readout while the menu is closed, and where it sits.
fps_overlay = off
fps_overlay_yaw = 0
fps_overlay_pitch = -16

# Metres from your head to the panel, and how much it wraps toward you.
# Live.
distance = 1.4
curve = 0.2

# The height of a capital letter, and the panel's width, in degrees of
# your view. Live.
text_degrees = 1.1
width_degrees = 30

# Close after this many seconds without a key or a look; 0 stays open
# until dismissed, which is what it ships doing. Live.
idle_dismiss = 0

# Seconds resting on a row before its explanation appears beside the
# panel; 0 never shows one. Live.
tooltip_delay = 1.5

# One-line confirmations when a setting changes outside the menu. Live.
toasts = on

# Adds the Advanced, Experimental and Instruments pages, and shows each
# setting's ini name. Everything on those pages is a safety valve or a
# developer instrument; the log names one when it wants you to change it.
# Also a switch at the bottom of the menu's own Performance page, so the
# extra pages can be turned on from inside the headset. Live.
# ui: Developer mode | menu performance
developer = off
```

The `[fix]` rows opt in on their existing `ui:` line: `# ui: Sharpening |
range 0..1 | percent | menu performance` puts a row on the Performance
page; a bare `| menu` puts it on Fixes. A `[fix]` row with no `menu` token
stays in the desktop window only.

**The summon default, F8, comes from a measurement** (2026-09-07, all 30
`.binds` files under the game's `ControlSchemes\`): across every stock
scheme, 75 bare keyboard keys and 7 chords are used (`CTRL+ALT+SPACE`,
`CTRL+SPACE`, `SHIFT+W/A/S/D`, and one pad chord); the whole cursor
cluster (Insert, Home, End, Delete, PageUp, PageDown) is taken by the thrust
bindings, and the Pause cluster is already EDVR's (`SCROLLLOCK`, `PAUSE`,
`NUMLOCK` earmarked). F2 through F9 are bound in no stock scheme; F1 is,
F10 and Alt+F10 are the game's hard-coded screenshot keys, F12 is Steam's,
Escape is the game menu. F8 is layout-independent and findable blind in
the F5-F8 group. Because the press is swallowed, a player who has bound F8
themselves loses only that binding, and the collision check says so at
launch. `CTRL+ALT+<letter>` would also be free (only Space is chorded that
way in stock) for anyone who prefers a chord.

## Architecture

**d3d11 half** (new files, `src/d3d11/`):

- `menu_model.cpp` -- pages, rows, highlight, the generated table
  (`menu_schema_gen.h`, a second output of `gen_settings_schema.py`
  carrying every section with its tier, kind, bounds, choices, applies and
  page), the restart snapshot and pending list.
- `menu_input.cpp` -- the summon key through `Hotkey`, the navigation keys
  through the same edge-and-repeat polling, head-aim from `headPose()`
  against the published anchor, idle timing through `timing.h`.
- `menu_raster.cpp` -- GDI DIB rasterisation on a worker thread, the
  double-buffered texture, the toast bitmap.
- `menu_ini.cpp` -- the write path above, on top of `common/iniedit`.
- `input_gate.cpp` -- the doors: the dinput8 dummy devices and their
  in-place vtable patches (`VTableHook`, InPlace, `reclaim()` from the frame
  path), the exe-IAT patches (`common/iat_hook`), the summon-key scan code,
  the input probe.
- The export `edvrMenuPanel(outTex, eye, tangents4, xf12, alpha)`: draws the
  current panel and toast onto `outTex`. Bumps the "drawn" stamp the gate
  checks.

**native runtime** (EDVR's OpenXR runtime, the door lambda): reads the
channel's menu flag and anchor, takes the shadow copy if the outgoing
texture is the game's, computes `xf` per eye as the theater does with the
real eye offset, calls the export, submits what came back. Publishes one
new word: the runtime kind, for the Status page.

**Channel** (`frame_flag.h`): `publishMenuAnchor(m12)` / `menuAnchor()`,
`setMenuVisible(bool, alpha)` written every frame (a heartbeat, the
`externalCameraOnFoot` discipline, so "closed" and "d3d11 stopped saying"
stay distinguishable), `bumpMenuDrawn()` / `menuDrawnValue()` the other way,
and `announceRuntimeKind(k)`.

**Common**: `iniedit` and `mirrorDirFor` move in; `iat_hook.h` is new.

**Tests** (`tools/`): `menu_test` drives the model through keys and aim
with the test clock (rate-invariant repeat and idle, hysteresis, the
pending-restart diff); `gate_test`-style fixtures for the doors against a
fake `IDirectInputDevice8` vtable (the filter policy: zeroed state, ups
kept, downs dropped, non-keyboard devices untouched, foreign entry chained)
and against a synthetic import table; `installer_test` already proves the
one-value merge and gains the atomic-write case.

## Phase 0 -- what must be measured before code depends on it

1. **G1, the input probe** (`advanced.input_probe = on`, an instrument in
   the gaze probe's style): with the doors installed pass-through, count
   per five seconds the game's calls to `GetDeviceState` and
   `GetDeviceData` (A and W), to each of the user32 trio, and the keyboard
   messages seen by `PeekMessageA`, plus any `WM_INPUT` (which would mean a
   dynamic Raw Input registration the import table hid). Decides which
   doors matter and whether one is missing.
2. **G2, reach and attribution.** The dummy-device table patch is reached by
   a `this` that is not ours within ten seconds of play (else "not
   reached", and the menu runs shared). The install line names the module
   each slot pointed at before the patch, on both installs; the Steam
   overlay's presence in the chain is the expected finding there.
3. **G3, the modal test.** Hold a thrust key, summon: thrust stops. Close
   with the key still held: thrust resumes. Type in the galaxy map search
   with the menu open: nothing lands. A key that leaks names the fourth
   path (the game's own `SetWindowsHookExA`) and gets a door of its own.
4. **G4, GDI beside the game.** Cost of one full re-raster at the Pimax's
   bitmap size (expected 1-3 ms, off the frame thread), no loader
   surprise at first use, and whether the glyphs satisfy at 1.1 degrees.
5. **G5, legibility in degrees**, both rigs -- performance.md's item 9.
6. **G6, head-aim comfort** -- item 10.
7. **G7, anchoring.** The panel holds under head translation and rotation
   on both rigs; it holds under `pose_hold`; the FSS theater and the menu
   coexist; the menu over the loading screen and the main menu.
8. **G8, the collision check.** The stock sweep is done (above); the live
   check runs against a real player's binds file with F8 deliberately
   bound in Elite, and the panel shows the warning.
9. **G9, the write round trip.** Write, immediate reload, mirror refreshed,
   the installer's window reopened reading the same value; a hand edit
   while the menu is open lands on the panel within the poll; the atomic
   replace never trips `config.cpp`'s size check.
10. **G10, fail-open.** Force the export to fail (a debug key): the flag
    clears within the stamp window and the game has its keyboard back; a
    forced fault in a door retires that door only.
11. **G11, focus.** Alt-Tab away with the menu open: idle dismiss closes it;
    the overlay (Shift+Tab) opens and closes cleanly with the menu up.
12. **G12, the restart snapshot.** Change a launch-time key by hand and by
    menu; the pending list, the footer count and the new audit line agree.
13. **G13, your Elite keys** (first flight on Sean's rig, 2026-09-11's
    change): W/S, A/D, Space, Q/E and L-Ctrl respond on Fixes;
    `menu: closed (UI_Back).` appears (the proof that
    `GetAsyncKeyState(VK_LCONTROL)` polls on this rig); `menu panel: footer
    line` says no line is ellipsised; on Monitor press E -> the menu's
    page changes (and E reaches the ship as Tab does there; with a cockpit
    panel open its tab cycles, with none open nothing happens -- the
    BELIEVED half); on Monitor press W -> nothing in the menu; hold E on
    Fixes so the page lands on Monitor -> one page change only, and the
    ship does nothing until E is released and pressed again; hold W, press
    F8 -> the highlight does not move; open a Number row with Enter while
    holding a letter -> the buffer is unchanged; hold W on Status, press
    Tab -> nothing fires on Performance.
    Desk half, no headset: with Elite at its main menu, rebind
    CycleNextPanel in Options > Controls > Interface Mode and Apply; within
    15 s the log shows `hotkey: your Elite bindings files changed...`
    followed by exactly one `menu keys: your Elite bindings changed -- ...`
    line naming the new key.
14. **G14, the leak audit** (G3's shape): every adopted and fixed key
    pressed on Fixes moves nothing in the ship; `advanced.input_probe`
    counts zero game-side downs.

## Phasing

- **A, the menu** (this design's v1): the three doors, the model, pages
  1-3, head-aim plus keys, toasts, the ini write path, restart flagging
  with its build gate, the developer tier with pages 4-6. Ships default
  on with `keyboard = private`, because the whole point is that it is safe
  to.
- **B, the extras**: typing a value, pad navigation and door 4, the
  performance monitor's "move it here" row (Feature 5), per-row measured
  costs as each pass gains a timestamp pair.
- **C, gaze**: aim by eye and dwell-to-select, the day a driver publishes a
  usable centre; the highlight then becomes the tracker's live sanity
  check, as Feature 4 hoped.

## Open questions for Sean

1. **F8 as the summon default**, or a chord? The sweep says either is free;
   a single key is easier blind.
2. **`keyboard = private` by default.** The design assumes yes; `shared` is
   there for a rig where a door misbehaves.
3. **`developer` under `[menu]`** rather than `[advanced]`, since it changes
   what the menu shows and nothing else. And whether the Instruments page
   should fire the dev hotkeys' functions at all, or only show them.
4. **Which `[fix]` rows get the `menu` token** in the first cut. The
   proposal above is the Performance list plus every live-editable fix
   with a choice or a toggle; the metre offsets stay desktop-only as the
   generator's comment argues.
