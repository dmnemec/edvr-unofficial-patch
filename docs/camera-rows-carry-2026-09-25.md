# Camera rows after a drop: a parked camera's zero

## Status

*Last updated 2026-09-28: H2 remains convicted; 162120 rules it out for its
captured frames.*

- **State:** the 2026-09-25 gate fix (branch `claude/camera-rows-carry`, merged
  to main) is FLOWN and working as designed, and its open hypothesis is now
  closed by evidence: H2 CONVICTED 2026-09-27 (the dated entry, eye run 055427)
  -- a parked stay of 4674 frames (~52 s) in one frontier session, and a dump
  that caught a carried ~zero through a 12.6 px head move: the world path's MV
  read ~0 for 14 straight frames while the content moved every frame, and the
  station hull (84% on the world path at that range) blurred under its own
  motion. The stand-down the doc deferred is now owed: after how many carried
  frames, and to what.
- **Symptom:** a brief sky/world smear during a roll or turn, two frames long,
  wherever the transition-flash tracker logs a "camera parked at" line. Found
  in eye run 050423 (flight log `edvr_gfx_20260925_050051`, Frontier, build
  c9cab91e = v0.18.0-rc.1). And the long form: a sustained smear for the length
  of a stay, 055427.
- **Cause (confirmed from the dump):** after the chooser landed on a parked
  auxiliary pass (148 deg from the view, rejected, carried), the next frame
  took the same pass's identical write. That delta was zero, and under a still
  head a zero passes the 3-degree test. The old gate ACCEPTED it and stored it
  as the last good. The next frame, back on the view, carried the zero.
- **Open hypothesis, the entry (H1):** the chooser left the view because
  nothing in 19996 was within 3 deg of 19995's rows: a hitch of about 16 frames
  of flight (below). In this dump the hitch was probably the eye run's own draw
  census. The fix does not depend on H1.
- **H2 (closed, convicted):** "if stays run long, a stale carry is a worse
  guess than the head path, and the world path should stand down after a few
  frames." Stays run long: 4674 frames. The stand-down is the open design.
- **Open, the scale (H3, the 2026-09-27 entry):** the rows' delta undershot the
  head's by (1+k), k = -0.347, over a whole frontier session near the station,
  with a steady (+0.11, -0.88) px registration offset on the world-depth
  probes; auxiliary passes jump ~9300 units every ~120 frames and were chosen
  on 4032 frames. Interleaved auxiliary writes or a sampling skew against the
  head stream -- undecided.
- **Ruled out / declined:** see "Declined" at the end. It covers measuring from
  the last accepted rows, and refusing every delta after a drop.
- **Latest evidence (162120):** all 16 actual scene-row blocks match the
  selected rows within 5e-6; all 32 eyes accept/bind rows with follow 30. Stale
  carry and later auxiliary selection contamination do not explain this run.
  World-covered detail still misses raw-image motion; the confirmed
  substitution-ownership defect and existing F7 repair belong to the
  kinematic-motion doc, 2026-09-28 entry. Earlier H2 and the session-wide H3
  question remain open work.
- **Next:** no additional Coriolis flight is planned until a concrete repair is
  proven. The earlier roll/turn protocol in "Verification" remains the
  discriminating test for the H2 stand-down once designed.
- **Environment:** depends on the world path (`fix.temporal_aa`, depth motion)
  and the game's view rows at float 932 of the scene block. It does not depend
  on the VR runtime, headset or DLSS version, since it reads the game's own
  rows. Flown rig: Pimax (runtime "Pimax OpenXR") on EDVR's native runtime,
  DLSS 2037x1969 -> 4074x3938 per eye. Fixed-size table: the chooser's ring of
  256 writes (unchanged).


## The event (eye run 050423, eye 0)

`eye_050423_motion.csv`, crops 0 to 5, turn and move computed from the
rows:

| frame | rows prev -> now | turn | move | rowsOk | world delta used |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 19994 | view -> view | 0.72 deg | 0.73 | 1 | its own |
| 19995 | view -> view | 0.88 deg | 0.76 | 1 | its own (D95) |
| 19996 | view -> AUX | 148.45 deg | 21.65 | 0 | D95 carried |
| 19997 | AUX -> AUX (identical) | 0.000 | 0.000 | **1** | **identity, accepted** |
| 19998 | AUX -> view | 148.36 deg | 7.47 | 0 | **identity carried** |
| 19999 | view -> view | 1.56 deg | 1.73 | 1 | its own |

AUX is `(-199.5, 1491.6, 779.8)`. It matches the transition-flash tracker's
"parked" cameras in the same session (`(-170 +1170 +595)` at 05:04:18,
`(-204 +1548 +812)` at 05:04:26). Those cameras sit along the ship's path,
re-placed every second or two. `rowsBound` is 1 on every frame, so the
auxiliary pass writes into the same block as the view.

The census line at 05:04:31 covers the whole session (3 min 40 s). The
delta was dropped on 120 eye-frames as another camera's: 60 frames over two
eyes. An event of this shape drops two (the entry and the exit), so that is
up to 30 events, about one every 7 s. The chooser resynced ("nothing
followed last frame's") on 52 frames. Only stays of two frames or more hit
the bug: a one-frame stay has no frame in between to accept a zero. The
accepted zeros were counted nowhere; the new "parked" count is their
witness.

## The entry (H1): a hitch

On every frame the turn and the move keep the same ratio, about 0.9 deg
per unit: a steady roll and speed, with each frame's share scaling with its
frame time (20008, a long frame, has 2.88 deg and 3.19 units). From 19995
to 19998 the view turned 25.9 deg and moved 29.1 units. That is the same
ratio, so it is the same flight, but it is about 16 frames of it in three.
So the view's own write in 19996 was more than 3 deg from 19995's rows, the
chooser found nothing continuous, and its resync took the bound block's
latest write, which was the parked pass's. The eye run armed its draw
census at 05:04:23.499 (`DC begin census=1 frames=3`), which wrote 10,804
log lines in two seconds. That is the likely hitch in this dump. The rest
of the session's events happened without a dump, so hitches in ordinary
flight also enter this way. A dump taken with the census off, or a timed
frame log, would separate the two.

Nothing reprojects a quarter-second hitch. The view's own delta at 19996
was well over 3 deg and would have been dropped anyway. Carrying the last
real delta across it is the best available.

## The mechanism

`chooseCameraRows` follows continuity from last frame's pick, and the
plausibility block measured each frame's delta from last frame's pick. Once
a frame was rejected, its rows (the parked pass) became the next frame's
reference for both of them. The chooser then found the parked pass's
identical write continuous (the twin fallback, "for a camera that truly
stood still"). The gate saw a zero delta against a head turning 0.02 deg
and passed it, because the 3-degree test only bounds the ship's turn and a
zero is a plausible ship turn. Stored as the last good, the zero was then
carried by the exit frame.

## The fix (temporal_math.h: `temporalCameraGateStep`, `temporalCameraGateAdvance`)

- The gate keeps a standing for the reference rows (`refOwn`). It moves on
  once a frame, at `temporalPassFrameBoundary`. The rows are the view's own
  only if a delta to them was measured and neither eye refused it. Rows no
  delta reached, such as the first after a frame with no write, are not.
- A delta measured from rows that are not the view's own, whose orientation
  matches them to the last bit, is refused (`Parked`). A tracked head does
  not hold the same orientation from one frame to the next, so rows that
  did not turn at all belong to a parked or world-fixed camera. The last
  good delta is carried, and the rows stay suspect through the whole stay,
  including a pass re-parked with the same orientation.
- A delta that turns and passes the 3 degrees restores the standing. The
  view resuming after a hitch or a resync (19999) is accepted at once, as
  before, so recovery costs no frame.
- Unchanged: the 3-degree test (`Another`); the floating origin's jump
  (the translation dropped before the last-good store); the carried-delta
  witnesses (`g_camCarried`, and `g_camCarriedJump`, zero by construction);
  a still twin after the view's own rows is still accepted as the identity.
- New census clause: "on N as a parked camera's (not turned at all, from
  rows a drop had left; the longest stay M frames)". N counts eye-frames;
  M counts frames, once for both eyes. The eye trace's `rowsOk` is 0 on a
  refused frame.
- The world delta arithmetic moved unchanged from the pass's lambda into
  `temporalWorldFromRows`, so the rig runs the pass's own code. The rig
  reproduces the DLL's dumped `cameraR`/`cameraTv` for 19995 and 19999 to
  1e-5.

## Verification

Next flight, Frontier install:

```bash
python tools\install_edvr.py --target frontier --verify-only
python tools\edvr_log.py --target frontier --expect-build HEAD --version
python tools\edvr_log.py --target frontier --grep "registration, the rest|camera parked at"
```

- Pass: in `eye_<stamp>_motion.csv`, no frame that follows a `rowsOk 0`
  frame shows a zero prev -> now rotation with `rowsOk 1` during a roll. A
  refused frame shows `rowsOk 0`, and its `cameraR` is the last real delta
  (about a degree of roll), not the identity.
- The census's new "parked camera's" count is non-zero on a flight with
  parked-camera lines. That is the witness: those are the frames the old
  gate would have accepted as zero. Its "longest stay" answers H2: a few
  frames leaves the carry as it is, and tens of frames call for the stand-
  down.
- Fail signatures: a `rowsOk 1` identity after a `rowsOk 0` during a roll.
  Either the fix is not running (check the version line), or the parked
  pass's rows changed orientation by a hair between frames, which is a
  variant that bitwise identity does not catch and needs its own look. A
  world that visibly spins on after a roll has stopped, with a long stay
  on the census, is H2.

## Declined

- **Measuring the next delta from the last ACCEPTED rows** (asked for as
  the first option): after a real jump of more than 3 deg (a hitch), every
  later frame is measured across the jump from a stale anchor, and none is
  accepted again. It would need an escape hatch, and that hatch is this
  fix's recovery rule.
- **Refusing every delta after a drop** (the second option, literally): it
  either never recovers, if a refused frame counts as a drop, or accepts
  the second frame of a two-frame parked stay, if only the 3-degree test
  counts. The standing is the working form of it: refuse what did not turn,
  and restore on what did.
- **A tighter angle test against the carried delta** (the ship's turn rate
  is continuous): it needs a threshold between 0.45 deg (19999 against
  19995's rate, a real change of frame time) and 0.88 deg (a zero against
  19995). That is a threshold nudge, not a cause.
- **Changing the chooser's reference after a drop:** the chooser must keep
  following the rejected rows. After a hitch those rows ARE the view, and
  continuity from them is how the view is found again.

## 2026-09-27 -- H2 convicted, and a scale problem beside it (eye run 055427)

Frontier, build v0.18.0-rc.2-2-g2b285732, parked close to a coriolis port;
game build 332841. The session census (05:54:42, whole 3.4 min session): the
camera's delta was dropped as a parked camera's on 13,462 eye-frames and the
LONGEST STAY WAS 4674 FRAMES (~52 s) -- H2's witness is in, and tens of
frames were the bar for the stand-down. The eye run (055427, 16 frames,
05:54:27) caught a stay spanning real motion: the stored world-path MV reads
~0 from its frame 2 through 15 while the rendered content, measured by grid
search on the raw frames, moved 0.6-12.6 px a frame (a 12.6 px head move at
frames 1-3, then a steady ~1 px/frame drift). Deep space reads the same zero
as the hull, so the carried delta itself was ~zero. DLSS got that MV on 84%
of the port face and dragged its history: the station blurred along its
motion, exactly H2's "a stale carry is a worse guess than the head path".
Full measurement table in docs/kinematic-motion-injection-2026-09-19.md's
2026-09-27 entry.

Beside the stays, a second, chronic reading: "the rows turned (1+k) times
the head, k = -0.347 (x -0.309, y -0.295, z -0.544), leading by -0.17
frames" over the session, and the history's best match sat (+0.11, -0.88) px
from the world path's prediction across 5758 probes -- a steady offset, i.e.
a lag or a scale, not noise. The rows also chose "another's" block on 4032
frames while auxiliary passes near the station jumped ~9300 units every ~120
frames. Whether the undershoot is interleaved auxiliary writes or a sampling
skew against the head stream is open -- call it H3. H1's hitch question also
stands: the eye run's own hitch remains the suspected entry for the dump's
stay, and the 05:53:52 window (mid-approach, no dump running) already had
parked carries, so ordinary flight enters too.

Open design question, now owed an answer: the stand-down -- after how many
carried frames, and to what (no history at all, or the head path) when the
world's own rows cannot be trusted. 055427's stay outlasted a 12.6 px move;
that is the cost of the current answer.

## 2026-09-28 -- 162120 does not reproduce the stale-carry defect

Frontier eye run 162120, failed-fix build f2f27f97: all 16 actual captured
scene-constant camera blocks match the selected rows within 5e-6, and all 32
eye evaluations have rowsOk=1, rowsBound=1, rowsFollow=30. The ledger's
pre-boundary frame convention is deliberate: ledger.frame = CSV.frame+1
(object_probe.cpp, ledgerNoteDraw), not a C/D motion lag.

ruled out: stale carry and later auxiliary selection contamination as the blur
cause IN THIS RUN, because the accepted/bound rows are the rows used by the
captured scene. This does not retract 055427's 4674-frame stay or its dead
world vectors; H2 remains a real, separately evidenced defect outside this
dump.

Independent raw-image warps need <=0.05 input px median quiet correction on
engine pixels but roughly 0.3-0.6 px on world-covered details, with a 6 px
opening-motion miss. Production-patcher hash proof identifies the alleged
native/refused shaders as EDVR's own substitutions, mishandled by the old
PS-shadow probe. Current main already contains F7's ownership repair, absent
from this installed build. The old-source F7 reproduction, stronger next-frame
regression, and full production/installer validation have passed; promotion,
installation, and headset verification follow. The complete ROI table and
reconstruction-floor exclusion live in
docs/kinematic-motion-injection-2026-09-19.md's 2026-09-28 entry. No new flight
is needed for diagnosis before that verified repair is installed.
